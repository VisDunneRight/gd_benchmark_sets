# Blogposts, Tweets, and Forums

Note: In the surveyed papers we found various instances of blogposts, tweets, and forum posts. Many of these are timestamped posts that connect user mentions, textually derived entities, hashtags, or user actions on posts. We provide a selection of Blogposts, Tweets, and MOOC (a student forum) as found in the literature. 
Origin Notes: Time Arcs uses AMERICAblog, Huffington Post, and other sources (corpus_ner_geo) data which can be found at https://github.com/CreativeCodingLab/TimeArcs/tree/master/Text/data.

Fast filtering uses the Twitter gardenhouse streaming API to collect data on the 2013 Super Bowl and the announcement of Osama Bin Laden’s death, both can be found https://github.com/WICI/fastviz/tree/master/data (shared hashtags).

Event-based Dynamic Graph Drawing without the Agonizing Pain uses the rugby tweet dataset (pro12_mentions) consisting of mentions among the members of the GuinessPro12 competition, and the MOOC dataset from the http://moocdata.cn/challenges/kdd-cup-2015 (A data challenge).

## Blogs/MOOC

### Descriptions from Literature

From [TimeArcs: Visualizing Fluctuations in Dynamic Networks](https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12882):

> We collected 90,811 political blog posts over a ten-year period from 2005 to 2015 from seven different sources, including AMERICAblog, Huffington Post, and ProPublica. We then ran text analyses on these blogs and generated terms that were classified into four different categories. These terms were then input into *TimeArcs*.

From [Event-based Dynamic Graph Drawing without the Agonizing Pain](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cgf.14615):

> MOOC represents the actions (e.g. viewing a video, submitting an answer, etc.) taken by users on a popular massive open online class platform [[KZL19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cgf.14615#cgf14615-bib-0037)]. The nodes represent users and course activities (targets), and temporal edges represent the actions by users on the targets. We pick and elaborate the first 15 thousands events.

**Fig. 7.** Overview of political events in the past 10 years using TimeArcs. The top 100 terms were selected based on their sudden attention and degree centrality. Terms are color-coded by category: green for person, red for location, blue for organization, yellow for miscellaneous category.

### Descriptions from Literature

From  [Fast filtering and animation of large dynamic networks](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0027-8):

> We use data obtained through the Twitter gardenhose streaming API, which covers around 10% of the tweet volume.We focus on two events: the announcement of Osama bin Laden’s death and the 2013 Super Bowl. We consider user mentions and hashtags as entities and their co-occurrence in the same tweet as interactions between them.

From [Event-based Dynamic Graph Drawing without the Agonizing Pain](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.14615):

> **Rugby** is a network derived from over 3000 tweets involving teams in the ‘Guinness Pro12’ rugby competition. The tweets were posted between 1 September 2014 and 23 October 2015. Each tweet contains information about the involved teams and the time of publication with a precision down to the second.

== STOP RENDERING ==

**Online dynamic -**  cannot find code online, paper shows two links of where they collected the data. Both broken [http://www.dailytech.com](http://www.dailytech.com/), [http://www.rimzu.com](http://www.rimzu.com/) - paper says to look in [https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg/2008/04/ttg2008040727/13rRUxBJhvo](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg/2008/04/ttg2008040727/13rRUxBJhvo) but it is asking me to pay

**Turing Test -** Uses the Zachary Karate dataset (they link to the suiteSparse Matrix collection, but I also know it is in sparse, and one of the Pajek subcollections). Also uses a timeslice of the same dataset used by Online dynamic (we could reconstruct this from their images since it is also only 85 nodes, but we really loose all the info we want)
