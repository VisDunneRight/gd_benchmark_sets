### Descriptions from Literature

From “[An Experimental Study on the Ply Number of Straight-Line Drawings](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53925-6_11)”:

> **Graph Datasets.** To understand whether the experimental results are influenced by the structure of the graph we considered several graph families. All graphs are of small or medium size, expressed as the number of their vertices. In some cases, the size and the number of instances used for each graph family depends on the type of question we want to answer (see Sect. 5 for details). We used the following datasets:
**Trees.** Generated with uniform probability distribution using Pru ̈fer sequences [28].
**Planar.** Connected simple planar graphs, generated with the OGDF library [6].
**General.** Connected simple graphs, generated with uniform probability distribution.
**Scale-free.** Scale-free graphs, generated according to the Barabasi-Albert model [2].
**Caterpillars.** Each caterpillar of n vertices is generated by first creating a path (spine of the caterpillar) of length $k\in [ \frac{n}{4} , \frac{n}{2} ]$ (randomly chosen), and attaching each remaining vertex to a randomly selected vertex of the spine.
**Paths, Cycles.** For each desired number of vertices n, there is only one (unlabeled) path and one (unlabeled) cycle of n vertices.
**k-ary Trees.** Rooted trees where each node has either 0 or k children. Each tree is generated by starting with a single vertex and then creating k children of a randomly selected leaf, until the desired number n of vertices is achieved. When n cannot be obtained, we use a value close to it.

From “[An Interactive Tool to Explore and Improve the Ply Number of Drawings](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_4)”:

> **FM3data** contains 50 caterpillars with 250 to 450 vertices… **FM3data** also contains planar graphs ranging from 250 to 400 vertices and a density ranging from 1.5 to 2… The remaining subset of **FM3data** consists of general graphs with 250 to 450 vertices and the densities 1.5 and 2.5.
