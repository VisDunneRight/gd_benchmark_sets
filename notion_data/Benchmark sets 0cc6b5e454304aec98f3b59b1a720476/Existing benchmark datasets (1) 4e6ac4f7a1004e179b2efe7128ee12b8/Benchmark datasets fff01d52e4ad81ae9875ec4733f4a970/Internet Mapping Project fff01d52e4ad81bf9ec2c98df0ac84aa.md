# Internet Mapping Project

Origin Notes: The original Internet Mapping Project started at Bell lab in 1998. It was then transferred to the Lumeta Corporation, however, links to this corporation are broken.  A gallery of images still remains publicly available, hosted by Bill Cheswick on this personal website.

### Description from Literature

From “[Topological fisheye views for visualizing large graphs](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2005.66)”:

> Fig. 7 shows two topological fisheye views of a published Internet map [4]. It is a large tree (|V|=87,931, |E|=87,930) made by tracing connections from a central probe to all reachable IP subnets. The full layout of this graph in Fig. 7a is too dense to read. In contrast, our approach, seen in Fig. 7b and Fig. 7c, yields useful views by focusing on different portions of the graph.

**Fig. 7.** This Internet map ((|V|=87,931, |E|=87,930)) is too large to visualize as a flat structure. Two topological fisheye views are shown. The focused sections in orange are the original graph. Peripheral areas, in blue, are simplified.
