Notes: dataset used: S. Hachul and M. Junger. An experimental comparison of fast algorithms for drawing general large graphs. In Proc. 13th Int. Symp. on Graph
Drawing. Springer-Verlag, 2005.

only shows results and does not measure anything

”Instead of using an error
measurement, we judge the quality of output intuitively based on
how much it can reveal an input graph’s specific structure.”
