abstract="Shape-based metrics measure how faithfully a drawing D represents the structure of a graph G, using the proximity graph S of D. While some limited graph classes admit proximity drawings (i.e., optimally shape-faithful drawings, where {\$}{\$}S = G{\$}{\$}S=G), algorithms for shape-faithful drawings of general graphs have not been investigated.",
