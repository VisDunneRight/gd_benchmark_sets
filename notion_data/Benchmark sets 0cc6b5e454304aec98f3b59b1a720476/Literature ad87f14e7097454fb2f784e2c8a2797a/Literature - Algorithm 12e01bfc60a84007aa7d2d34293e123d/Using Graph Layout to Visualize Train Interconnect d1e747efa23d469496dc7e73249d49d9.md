abstract="We are concerned with the problem of visualizing interconnections in railroad systems. The real-world systems we have to deal with contain connections of thousands of trains. To visualize such a system from a given set of time tables a so-called train graph is used. It contains a vertex for each station met by any train, and one edge between every pair of vertices connected by some train running from one station to the other without halting in between.",
