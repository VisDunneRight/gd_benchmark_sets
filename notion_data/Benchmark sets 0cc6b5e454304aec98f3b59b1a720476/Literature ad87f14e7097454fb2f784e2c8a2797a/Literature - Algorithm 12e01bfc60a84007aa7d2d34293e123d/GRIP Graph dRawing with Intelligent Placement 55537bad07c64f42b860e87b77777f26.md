abstract = {This paper describes a system for Graph dRawing with Intelligent Placement, GRIP. The system is designed for drawing large graphs and uses a novel multi-dimensional force-directed method together with fast energy function minimization. The system allows for drawing graphs with tens of thousands of vertices in under a minute on a mid-range PC. To the best of the authors' knowledge GRIP surpasses the fastest previous algorithms. However, speed is not achieved at the expense of quality as the resulting drawings are quite aesthetically pleasing.},
