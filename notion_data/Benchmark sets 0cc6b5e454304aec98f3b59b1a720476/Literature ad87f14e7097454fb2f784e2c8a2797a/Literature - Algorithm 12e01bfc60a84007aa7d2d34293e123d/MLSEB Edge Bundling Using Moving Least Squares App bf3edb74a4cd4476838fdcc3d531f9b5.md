Notes: edge bundling algorithm
- does not precisely list the source of the data 
- pretty large dataset 

thoughts: maybe the enron dataset would be fitting for edge bundling techniques too
paper type: algorithm
Technique: other
Graph feature: Bundled edges (generated), Spatial
Dataset tag clean: Airlines/Migration Routes
Dataset used: Airlines - US airlines, US migrations, France airlines, large US migrations
dataset size: 4
Dataset tag relations: Airlines, Migrations, and Air Traffic (../../../Benchmark%20datasets%2064e0439269f9497799025562a4087ce1/Airlines,%20Migrations,%20and%20Air%20Traffic%2045ffa6caedd141b082e163d7da6eb895.md)
Type of edit to the dataset: NA
Size of graphs (Clean up): NA
Size of graphs: US migrations dataset: 9780 edges 
France airlines dataset: 17274 edges
Reports only edges no nodes
Easy to find info about graphs?: In Figure, NO
Results measured: Clutter, Distortion, Running Time
Results measured comment: clutter and distortion are important because this paper deals with graphs on maps
