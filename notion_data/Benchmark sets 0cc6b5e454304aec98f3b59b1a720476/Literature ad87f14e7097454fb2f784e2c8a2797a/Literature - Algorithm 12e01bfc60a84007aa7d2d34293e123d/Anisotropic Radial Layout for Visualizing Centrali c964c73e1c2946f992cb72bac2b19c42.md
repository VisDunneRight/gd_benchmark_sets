Type of edit to the dataset: NA
Size of graphs (Clean up): 34 - 77
Size of graphs: 34-77
les miserables: 77 nodes, each representing a character in the novel, and 254 weighted edges

zachary’s karate club: 34 nodes, each representing an individual, and 78 unweighted
edges that represent a friendship between the associated individuals

terrorist network: 64 nodes that represent suspects and their relatives, and 243 edges that have weights ranging from 1 to 4 which represent an aggregated
strength of connection
