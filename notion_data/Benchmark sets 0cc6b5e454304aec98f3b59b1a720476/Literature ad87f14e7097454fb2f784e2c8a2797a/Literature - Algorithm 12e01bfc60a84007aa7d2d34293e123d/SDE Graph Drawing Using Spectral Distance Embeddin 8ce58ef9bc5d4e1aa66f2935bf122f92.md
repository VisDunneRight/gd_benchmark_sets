abstract="We present a novel graph drawing algorithm which uses a spectral decomposition of the distance matrix to approximate the graph theoretical distances. The algorithm preserves symmetry and node densities, i.e., the drawings are aesthetically pleasing. The runtime for typical 20,000 node graphs ranges from 100 to 150 seconds.",
