abstract="The crossing number of a graph G is the smallest number of edge crossings in any drawing of G into the plane. Recently, the first branch-and-cut approach for solving the crossing number problem has been presented in [3]. Its major drawback was the huge number of variables out of which only very few were actually used in the optimal solution. This restricted the algorithm to rather small graphs with low crossing number.",
