abstract = {Abstract Layout symmetry is an important and desired feature in graph drawing. While there is a substantial body of work in computer vision around the detection and measurement of symmetry in images, there has been little effort to define and validate meaningful measures of the symmetry of graph drawings. In this paper, we evaluate two algorithms that have been proposed for measuring graph drawing symmetry, comparing their judgments to those of human subjects, and investigating the use of stress as an alternative measure of symmetry. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of these measures, possible ways to improve them, and implications for the design of algorithms that optimize the symmetry in the layout.},
