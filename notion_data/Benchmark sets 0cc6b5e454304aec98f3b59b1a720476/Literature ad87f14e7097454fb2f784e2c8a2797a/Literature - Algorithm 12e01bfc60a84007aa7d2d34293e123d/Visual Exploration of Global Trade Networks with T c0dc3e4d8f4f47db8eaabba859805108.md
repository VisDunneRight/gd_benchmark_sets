abstract = {Abstract The UN Comtrade database is the world's largest repository of bilateral trade data. Their complexity poses a challenge to visualization systems, leading to issues such as scalability and visual clutter. Thus, we propose a radial layout-based visual exploration system to enable the user to smoothly explore the change over time and to explore different commodity classes at once by using a novel edge bundling concept. We evaluated our system with the aid of a group of domain experts.},
