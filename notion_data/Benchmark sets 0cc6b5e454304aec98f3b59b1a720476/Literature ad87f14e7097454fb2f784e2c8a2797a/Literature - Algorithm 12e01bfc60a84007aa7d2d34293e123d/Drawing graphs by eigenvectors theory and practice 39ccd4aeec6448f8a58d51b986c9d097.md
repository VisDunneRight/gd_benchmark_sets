abstract = {The spectral approach for graph visualization computes the layout of a graph using certain eigenvectors of related matrices. Two important advantages of this approach are an ability to compute optimal layouts (according to specific requirements) and a very rapid computation time. In this paper, we explore spectral visualization techniques and study their properties from different points of view. We also suggest a novel algorithm for calculating spectral layouts resulting in an extremely fast computation by optimizing the layout within a small vector space.}
