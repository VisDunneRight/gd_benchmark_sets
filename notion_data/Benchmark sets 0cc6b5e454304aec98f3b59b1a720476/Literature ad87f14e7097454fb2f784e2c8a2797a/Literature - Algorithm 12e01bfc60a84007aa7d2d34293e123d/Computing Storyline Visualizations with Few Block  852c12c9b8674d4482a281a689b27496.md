description of how the custom dataset was generated: 

Random Instances. We test using random instances of two kinds. The first are
uniform instances and these are the same as in previous work [3]. First, pick κ,
n, and a probability p. (We report here on p = 0.5.) Then generate a meeting
by picking, independently at random with probability p, whether each character
is in the meeting. Reject meetings with fewer than two characters, and repeat
until there are n meetings. We let all characters be alive at all times, so we can
run all three algorithms.
