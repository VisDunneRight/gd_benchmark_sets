abstract="We present a new method for the application of 2-layer crossing reduction algorithms to layered compound http://graphs.it/ is based on an algorithm by Sander [9], [7], [8] and improves it with fewer crossings.Our method is optimal in the sense that it does not introduce unnecessary crossings by itself.If used with an optimal 2-layer crossing reduction algorithm, the crossing reduction for 2-layer compound graphs is optimal, too.",
