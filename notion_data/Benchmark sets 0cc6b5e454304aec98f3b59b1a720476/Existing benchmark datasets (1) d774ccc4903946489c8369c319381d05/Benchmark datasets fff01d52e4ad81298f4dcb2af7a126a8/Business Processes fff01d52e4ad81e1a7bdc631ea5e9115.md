# Business Processes

Note: Dataset links in supplemental materials are broken. After contacting the author, they mentioned that the other datasets were internal and could not be shared. 
Origin Notes: The Origin Paper collects various graphs from a few of sources. Some of these datasets are from international business process intelligence challenges, and others are specific processes from companies in a certain domain (hospital, road traffic management, pay processes, etc.).
graph features handled: Labeled nodes, N-layers
Graph features in papers: labeled nodes,layered graphs,n-layers

### Description From Literature

From [A stable graph layout algorithm for processes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13723):

> We use 13 datasets (see supplementary material), which represent real-world processes. For every dataset, we ran 500 tests on both methods. Each test involved a pair of randomly generated graphs  $G_1, G_2 \subseteq \bar{G}$  , which were obtained by randomly removing a subset of the edges $\bar{E}$ and then removing all nodes $n \in \bar{V}$ that became disconnected. Consequently, $G_1$ and $G_2$ are random sub-graphs of $\bar{G}$ .
