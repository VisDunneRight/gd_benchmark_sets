Note: This dataset is a proper subset of SNAP%20(Stanford%20Network%20Analysis%20Platform)%20fff01d52e4ad81f0bc11d53cc1f769cb.md and can be found there.
Origin Notes: Wallinger et al. randomly filter data from the original dataset collected by Leskovec et al. in The dynamics of viral marketing. Leskovec et al. collected 15 million recommendations made from June 2001, to May 2003 by looking at the “Customers who Bought This Item Also Bought” feature in the Amazon online shopping platform.
graph features handled: Directed edges, Large
Graph features in papers: bundled edges (generated),spatial

### Description from Literature

From [Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9552919)

> **Amazon Subset**
> 
> 
> This dataset consists of products with edges indicating that they are commonly co-purchased. We randomly filtered edges from the original graph [33], [34]. It has |V|=192k vertices and |E|=269k edges.
