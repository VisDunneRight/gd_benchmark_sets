# WebCompute

Note: Their website also features proofs of the crossing numbers of many of the Rome-Lib graphs. Newest version of database specifies non-planar graphs, but older versions do have some planar graphs.
Origin Notes: The dataset is comprised of instances of graphs uploaded to Crossing Number WebCompute, attributed to  M. Chimani, T. Wiedera. http://crossings.uos.de/cr-proof-system-paper.
graph features handled: Known crossing number, Nonplanar
Graph features in papers: generic

### Descriptions from Literature

From “[An ILP-based Proof System for the Crossing Number Problem](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2016.29)”:

> To determine the applicability of the proof system, we tested the algorithms on three
benchmark sets: the 3110 non-trivial Rome graphs [14], the 1277 North graphs [15], and the145 non-planar graphs ([http://crossings.uos.de/instances](http://crossings.uos.de/instances)) collected by our crossing
number web-service.
