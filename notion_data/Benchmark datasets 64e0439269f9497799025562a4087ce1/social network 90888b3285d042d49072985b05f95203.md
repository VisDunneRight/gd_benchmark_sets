# Zachary Karate Club Dataset

## Descriptions from the Literature

From Suite Sparse Matrix Collection:

> The graph "karate" contains the network of friendships between the 34 members of a karate club at a US university, as described by Wayne Zachary
in 1977.
> 

*The Turing Test for Graph Drawing Algorithms*  describes the dataset simply as “social network” in their Table 1.

## Example Figures

From [The Turing Test for Graph Drawing Algorithms:](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04869)

Figure form [supplementary materials](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~hcp/GD2020/) using a force directed layout.

InfoVis Co-Authorship (Discrete): a co-authorship network for papers published

in the InfoVis conference from 1995 to 2015 [1]. Authors collaborating on a paper

are connected in a clique at the time of publication of the paper. Note this is

not a cumulative network as authors can appear, disappear, and appear again.

The data is of discrete nature with exactly 21 timeslices (one per year).

Van De Bunt (Discrete): shows the relationships between 32 freshmen at

seven different time points. A discrete dynamic graph is built using the method

of Brandes et al. [9], with an undirected edge inserted into a timeslice if the

participants reciprocally report “best friendship” or “friendship” at that time.

Newcomb Fraternity Data (Discrete): contains the sociometric preference of

17 members of a fraternity in the University of Michigan in the fall of 1956 [39].

As in previous work [9], at each timeslice, we inserted undirected edges connect-

ing students to their three best friends.

Rugby (Continuous): is a network derived from over 3,000 tweets involving

teams in the Guinness Pro12 rugby competition. The tweets were posted between

09.01.2014 and 10.23.2015. Each tweet contains information about the involved

teams and the time of publication with a precision down to the second.

Pride and Prejudice (Continuous): lists the dialogues between characters in

the novel Pride and Prejudice in order [29]. The book has 61 chapters and the

data set includes over 4,000 interactions between characters
