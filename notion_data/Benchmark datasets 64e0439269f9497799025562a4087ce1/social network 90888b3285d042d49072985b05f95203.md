# Zachary Karate Club Dataset

## Descriptions from the Literature

*[The Turing Test for Graph Drawing Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-68766-3_36)*  describes the dataset simply as “social network” in their Table 1.

From [Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28):

> The Zachary’s karate club graph is a well known data set that is a social network of friendships in a karate club at a US university, as recorded during a study [[32](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28#ref-CR32)]. This graph contains 34 nodes, each representing an individual, and 78 unweighted edges that represent a friendship between the associated individuals (Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28#Fig1)). During the period of observation, a conflict between two key members, identified as the “administrator” and “instructor”, leads to a split in the club, giving it an interesting two cluster structure. In Fig. [1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28#Fig1), nodes representing members who are part of the instructor’s and administrator’s groups are drawn in green and blue, respectively.

# Facebook100

## Description from Literature

From [Untangling the Hairballs of Multi-Centered, Small-World Online Social Media Networks](https://jgaa.info/getPaper?id=370):

> As real world samples, we use the Facebook100 dataset [40], which contains social relations of 100 higher educational institutes in the US. The network size varies from 762 to 41K vertices and from 16K to 1.6M edges. Thedataset is directly from Facebook, not sampled, and thus very complete in terms of capturing the social relations according to a widely used service at that time. Additional attributes obtained from the Facebook profiles are gender, expected year of graduation, dormitory, etc. Due to incomplete profiles, a number of attribute values are missing.

## Example Figures

From [Untangling the Hairballs of Multi-Centered, Small-World Online Social Media Networks](https://jgaa.info/getPaper?id=370)

**Fig. 1.** Facebook friendships at California Institute of Technology (Caltech36). Vertex color corresponds to dormitory (gray for missing values), but has not been utilized by the layout algorithm. The layout in (a) is based on the entire graph, whereas (b)-(f) use edge embeddedness, which spreads the graph while keeping cohesive groups together. Embeddedness mapped to edge color; backbone edges dark gray.

# Facebook Ego Networks (Facebook 1864)

## Description from Literature

From ****[Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065)

> The Facebook1684 graph data set is an online social network with 775 nodes and 14,006 edges. The original graph and six samples are shown in Figure 4. This data set is an unbalanced graph in which two large communities include 705 nodes and two small communities/cliques contain only 70 nodes.
> 

The [supplemental](https://github.com/saibalmars/RicciFlow-SampleGraphs/tree/61f9c2c48d0de368369e232da959c4f996122e3a) material for *********[Network Alignment by Discrete Ollivier-Ricci Flow](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04414-5_32)* also provides user 1864 of the Facebook ego networks in their repository. 

From [A Random Sampling O(n) Force-calculation Algorithm for Graph Layouts](https://osf.io/dcz5h):

> The ego graphs are Facebook ego graphs [**[ML12](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13724#cgf13724-bib-0060)**] with the ego vertex re-added to the graph.

# Van De Bunt Fraternity

## Description from the Literature

From Preserving

> *Van De Bunt (Discrete):* shows the relationships between 32 freshmen at seven different time points. A discrete dynamic graph is built using the method of Brandes *et al.*  [[9](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_31#ref-CR9)], with an undirected edge inserted into a timeslice if the participants reciprocally report “best friendship” or “friendship” at that time.

# **Syphilis Social Network**

## Description from the Literature

From [SetCoLa: High-Level Constraints for Graph Layout](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440):

> Social networks can be a powerful way to understand inter-personal relationships and are useful for tracking the spread of diseases that result from personal contact [**[RST*98](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0045)**, **[FHH*01](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0022)**, **[MRV*03](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0043)**, **[FHD*11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0021)**]. The ability to track and identify at risk individuals can lead to treatment and help manage the spread of the disease. In addition to the links between individuals, structuring the layout by node properties such as the social or ethnographically-identified group may reveal additional details about how the disease is spread.

****************Fig. 4.**************** The layout for the syphilis social network from (a) Rothenberg et al. [[RST*98](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.13440#cgf13440-bib-0045)]. (b) We recreated and improved the layout in SetCoLa by introducing additional padding, alignment, and circle constraints to further highlight the relative number of interactions among the different groups. For both figures, the nodes are split into three groups, from left to right: young affluent white men, younger white women, and young African-American men. Individuals not associated with any of these “core” groups are positioned above the others. In both figures, individuals diagnosed with syphilis during the outbreak are labeled with an “S” on the node label.

> The rest of the test graphs are taken from real-world applications. In particular, we selected graphs from the AT&T graph library [1], from C. Walshaw’s graph collection [20], and a graph that describes a social network of 2113 people that we obtained from C. Lipp.
