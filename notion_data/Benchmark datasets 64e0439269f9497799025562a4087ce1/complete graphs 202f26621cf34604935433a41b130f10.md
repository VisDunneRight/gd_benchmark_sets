Note: we might have to generated them ourselves, not terrible and most implementations of grapph libraries have a way to 
Origin Notes: Both papers that cite complete graphs mention using the complete graph from n=5..50. We believe they might have just been generated and found no code for it

“**Complete graphs**- Although the crossing number of the complete graph Kn is not known for for n ≥ 13, the value is conjectured, and typically assumed to be correct. We compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value each of them is able to get, for various sizes of complete graphs up to n = 50. (An Effective Crossing Minimization heuristic…)”

Calculates crossing number on complete graphs K_n for 5≤n≤50, and bipartite complete graphs K_n1,n2 for 5≤n1≤n2≤40
