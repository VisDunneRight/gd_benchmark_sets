Origin Notes: Both papers that cite complete graphs mention using the complete graph from n=5..50. We believe they might have just been generated and found no code for it

“**Complete graphs**- Although the crossing number of the complete graph Kn is not known for for n ≥ 13, the value is conjectured, and typically assumed to be correct. We compare the nine combinations of schemes to see how close to the conjectured value each of them is able to get, for various sizes of complete graphs up to n = 50.
