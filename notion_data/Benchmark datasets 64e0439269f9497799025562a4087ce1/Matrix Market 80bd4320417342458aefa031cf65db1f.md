### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Graph Drawing by Stress Majorization](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_25)”:

> The first example is the 1138Bus graph (|V|=1138, |E|=1458) from the Matrix Market repository [1]. This graph models a network of high-voltage power distribution lines. Figure 4 shows two layouts of this graph.
