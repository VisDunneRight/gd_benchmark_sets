# Walshaw

Note: We do not provide the the data ourselves. Walshaw requests to be emailed for the distribution of the data, and so we link to their site and to the graphs found in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection. 
Origin Notes: C. Walshaw, collected for an archive of graph partitions which has been maintained since 2000.  These are multilevel mesh partitions of heterogeneous networks from a variety of domains. 
graph features handled: edge weighted, mesh, node weighted, partition
Graph features in papers: clusters (generated),generic,generic,generic,large,generic,high degree,large,dynamic,multilevel
Originally found at: https://chriswalshaw.co.uk/partition/ where C. Walshaw requests to be emailed for the dataset at mailto:c.walshaw@gre.ac.uk. the individual graphs can also be found on the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection under different groups. 

Size: 34 graphs, 2395-448695 nodes, 6837-3314611 edges. Node-weighted, edge-weighted. Partitions of the 34 graphs are given with various partition sizes and imbalance percentages.

### Descriptions from Literature

From “[An Experimental Comparison of Fast Algorithms for Drawing General Large Graphs](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11618058_22)”:

> The rest of the test graphs are taken from real-world applications. In particular, we selected graphs from the AT&T graph library [1], from C. Walshaw’s graph collection [20], and a graph that describes a social network of 2113 people that we obtained from C. Lipp.
> 

From “[A Combined Evolutionary Search and Multilevel Optimisation Approach to Graph-Partitioning](https://doi.org/10.1023/B:JOGO.0000042115.44455.f3)”:

> The test graphs have been chosen to be a representative sample of small to medium scale real-life problems (mostly mesh-based) and include both 2D and 3D examples of nodal graphs (where the mesh nodes are partitioned) and dual graphs (where the mesh elements are partitioned). In addition there is a 3D semi-structured graph, cti, which is unstructured in the x−y plane but extended regularly along the z-axis. Finally the test suite includes three non mesh-based graphs (add32, vibrobox, bcsstk32) which arise from various scientific computing applications2. None of the graphs have either vertex or edge weights; such graphs are not widely available since most applications do not accurately instrument costs and it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the few examples that we have access to.

```
Chris Walshaw's graph partitioning archive contains 34 graphs that
    have been very popular as benchmarks for graph partitioning algorithms
    ( http://staffweb.cms.gre.ac.uk/~wc06/partition/ ).

    17 of them are already in the UF Collection.  Only the 17 new graphs
    not yet in the collection are added here in the DIMACS10 set.
