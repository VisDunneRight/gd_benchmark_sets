### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Layer-Free Upward Crossing Minimization](https://doi.org/10.1145/1671970.1671975)”:

> **North DAGs.** The North DAGs have been introduced in an experimental comparison of algorithms for drawing DAGs [Di Battista et al. 2000]. The benchmark set contains 1,158 DAGs collected by Stephen North, which were slightly modified by Di Battista et al. The graphs are grouped into nine sets, where set $i$ contains graphs with $10 i$ to $10 i+9$ arcs for $i=1, \ldots, 9$.
