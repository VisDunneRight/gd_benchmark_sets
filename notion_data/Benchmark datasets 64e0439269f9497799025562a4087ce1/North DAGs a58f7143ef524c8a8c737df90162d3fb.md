### Description from papers

From “Layer-Free Upward Crossing Minimization”

> North DAGs. The North DAGs have been introduced in an experimental comparison of algorithms for drawing DAGs [Di Battista et al. 2000]. The benchmark set contains 1,158 DAGs collected by Stephen North, which were slightly modified by Di Battista et al. The graphs are grouped into nine sets, where set i contains graphs with 10i to 10i + 9 arcs for i = 1, . . . , 9.
