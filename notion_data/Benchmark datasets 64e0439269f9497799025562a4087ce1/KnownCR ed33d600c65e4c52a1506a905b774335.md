From *An effective crossing minimisation heuristic based on star insertion,* “KnownCR graphs- these are a set of instances containing between 9 and 250 vertices, first collected by Gutwenger [22], which can be further partitioned into four families of graphs as follows:

- Ci ×Cj: the Cartesian product of the cycle on i vertices with the cycle on j vertices. The instances contain graphs with 3 ≤ i ≤ 7 and j ≥i such that ij ≤ 250.
- Gi×Pj: the cartesian product of the path on j+1 vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where i denotes which of the 21. The instances contain graphs with 3 ≤ j ≤ 49.
- Gi ×Cj: the cartesian product of the cycle on j vertices with one of the 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs on 5 vertices, where i denotes which of the 21. The crossing number of these graphs are only known for some of the Gi and only these cases are included. The instances contain graphs with 3 ≤ j ≤ 50
- The Generalised Petersen graphs P(j,2) and P(j,3), on 2j vertices. We shall only use those of type P(j,3) as P(j,2) (studied in [20]) are154 Clancy et al. An effective crossing minimisation heuristic easy for heuristics to solve as has already been observed in [9]. The instances contain graphs with 9 ≤ j ≤ 125.” from **(An effective crossing minimisation heuristic based on star insertion, Clancy et al. )**
