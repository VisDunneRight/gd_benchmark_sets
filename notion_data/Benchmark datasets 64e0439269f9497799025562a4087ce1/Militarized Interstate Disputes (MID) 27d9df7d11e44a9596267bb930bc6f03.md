### Description From Literature

From [Design Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualizations:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327274)

> For the time-varying network, we use the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) network dataset [19].
> 

> For example, in the MID network dataset, which consists of 196 nations and 740 time steps, the genome length was reduced from 1714 to 432, allowing the algorithm to gain a considerable speedup.
> 

From [StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6634164):

> We conducted the experiment based on three movie datasets and a network dataset: Star Wars, Inception, The Matrix, and the MID network dataset (from 1817 to 1947).

StoryFlow: Tracking Evolution of Stories had no visualization-

“We failed to generate the storyline layout of the MID
data, so we used the results provided by Tanahashi.”
