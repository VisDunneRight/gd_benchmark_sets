Note: Data contains adjacency information and URLs as node attributes. 
Origin Notes: Found on the webpage of a 2002 computer science course at Cornell, instructed by Jon Kleinberg. They mention how the data was queried form a search engine, and that many of the original links are broken. 
graph features handled: clusters (generated), large

### Description from the Literature

From [A Treemap Based Method for Rapid Layout of Large Graphs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4475481):

> This particular graph is a non-weighted graph of links between search results for the word “California” (also in Figures 6, 8, and 9, |V|=6107,|E|=15160).
> 

From [Rapid Graph Layout Using Space Filling Curves](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658143)

> The “california” dataset (shown in Figures 5 and 8) consists of the links between the webpages found from a search for the word 'California' [4].

**Fig. 1.** *A graph laid out using our treemap based approach*. This graph portrays the links between websites that came from a search on the word “California” [7]. Nodes are clustered into a hierarchy, and laid out by applying a treemap to this hierarchy. Levels of the hierarchy below a threshold are clustered together into larger nodes. It can very easily be seen that there are three primary groups of websites that link to each other, and a plethora of others that are not as tightly linked.

**Fig. 5** *Separating clusters.* By adjusting the spacing between nodes according to the clustering information, clusters can be separated.
