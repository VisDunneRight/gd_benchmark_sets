# Neural Network

Note: The datasets are architecture graphs of trained machine learning networks. We do not provide the graphs corresponding to these models, as their structures are not fully described in the literature.
Origin Notes: The cifar and mnist_simple models are provided by http://tensorflow.org/. The authors of “https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598831” use a trained convolutional neural network of their own design which they call BaseCNN.
