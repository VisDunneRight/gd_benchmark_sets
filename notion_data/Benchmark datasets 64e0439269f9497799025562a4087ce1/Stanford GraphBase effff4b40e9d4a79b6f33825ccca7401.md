### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Crossing Minimization in Storyline Visualizations](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50106-2_29)”:

> Since the instances “Anna Karenina” and “Les Miserables” are very big, we have split them into chapters and sequences of chapters. The resulting test-bed is made of eight chapters, seven pairs of chapters, six triples of chapters and five quadruples of chapters from “Anna Karenina”, and five chapters, four pairs of chapters and three triples of chapters from “Les Mis ́erables”, plus the entire “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, “Inception-sf”, “Inception”, “Star Wars”, “The Matrix-sf”, and “The Matrix”.

From “[Anisotropic Radial Layout for Visualizing Centrality and Structure in Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_28)”:

> The third dataset is a graph of character associations in the famous French novel Les Miserables (Fig. 5) [18]. This graph consists of 77 nodes, each representing a character in the novel, and 254 weighted edges where the weights represent the number of chapters that feature both characters associated with an edge.
We see the that the main protagonist Valjean (marked in red) is placed prominently in all three visualizations (Fig. 5). However, other key characters in the plot such as Inspector Javert (blue) and Cosett (orange), who do not appear often with characters other than the protagonist (and thus have low betweenness centrality) are treated differently. While the radial layout relegates them to the periphery (far from Valjean) (Fig. 5b), MDS (Fig. 5a) paints a conflicting picture with regard to their centrality, e.g., Cosett’s node almost overlaps with Valjean despite its low centrality. In contrast, the proposed ARL (Fig.5c) is able to coherently convey the low centrality of the Inspector Javert and Cosett, as well as, their closeness to Valjean. The above issue of distance distortion appears to be a frequent occurrence in the radial layout due to many characters who have a low centrality value causing them to end up being packed in the outer periphery. A case of contrast is that of the character Bishop Myriel (green) who despite being associated with several characters, is only seen with Valjean once.
