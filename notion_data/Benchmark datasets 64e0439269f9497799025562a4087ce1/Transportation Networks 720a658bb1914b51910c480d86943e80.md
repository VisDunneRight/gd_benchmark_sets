### Description from Literature

> Apart from the example of Sydney presented in Section 6, we have evaluated our method for two additional real-world networks: Vienna, which is a rather small network, and London, the oldest and still one of the most complex metro systems in the world. These networks have not been used as examples for previous metro map layout methods, so we can compare only against the official maps of Vienna and London. The size of the metro graphs (including Sydney) is given in Table 3 and ranges from 84 vertices and 8 faces (Vienna) to 308 vertices and 55 faces (London). The table further shows how the removal of degree-2 vertices described in Section 5.1 effectively reduces the number of vertices and edges.
