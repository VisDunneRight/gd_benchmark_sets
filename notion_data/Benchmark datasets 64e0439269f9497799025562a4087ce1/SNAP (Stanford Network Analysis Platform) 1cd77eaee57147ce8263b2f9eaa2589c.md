# SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Platform)

Note: Well-known, widely used graph repository.
Note that BioSNAP, which consists of similar datasets for medical applications, exists under the same umbrella project. While BioSNAP was not as relevant in the literature, it may still prove useful for future researchers.
Origin Notes: The SNAP library is the collection of datasets assembled as part of the Stanford Network Analysis Platform, which started in 2004 and launched their website in 2009. The group attributes the dataset preparation to Ana Pavlisic. 
graph features handled: bipartite, categorical nodes, dense, directed edges, edge weighted, hierarchical, large, node weighted, signed, sparse, temporal
Graph features in papers: generic,large,clusters (generated),generic,almost proximity drawable graphs,mesh graphs,scale-free graphs,strong proximity drawable graphs,weak proximity drawable graphs

### Descriptions from Literature

From “[ForceAtlas2, a Continuous Graph Layout Algorithm for Handy Network Visualization Designed for the Gephi Software](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098679)”:

> We benchmarked our algorithm with a dataset of 68 networks from 5 to 23,133 nodes. We tried to gather varied networks corresponding to the actual use of Gephi (a lot of social networks, and scale-free networks in general). Most of these networks are from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection ([http://snap](http://snap/). [stanford.edu/data/](http://stanford.edu/data/)) and include social networks (Facebook and Twitter ego-networks), collaboration networks (from Arxiv) and autonomous systems (peering information inferred from Oregon route-views).
