# protein interactions

Added in paper: No
Appeared in years: 2
Cleaned ALL data: No
Graph features in papers: 6
In repo?: Yes
Note: Various types of protein intraction graphs are recorded in other datasets. We highlight two of them from the surveyed papers. First, we have the temporal Protein Interaction Publications, showing the history of how protein interactions were described in the literature. Second, the Protein Homology graph was provided by the Large Graph Layout project, their links are now broken however. Nonetheless, http://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/index.html and Konect both also have various dataset of human/other species protein interactions.

# Protein Interaction Publications

## Description from the Literature

From [TimeArcs: Visualizing Fluctuations in Dynamic Networks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.12882)

> The data contains the publication information (such as publication year, author, and textual evidence) of interactions between pairs of proteins, as well as their specific interaction type.
> 

## Example Figures

**Fig. 10**: TimeArcs visualization for interactions around PCAF protein. (1), (2), and (3) in the figure are supporting evidences in literature of “PCAF binds MAML”. 

# Protein Homology

## Description from the Literature

From [Rapid Graph Layout Using Space Filling Curves:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658143\)

> The “pgraph” dataset (shown in Figures 2 and 6) is a protein homology graph, which is relatively dense [7].
> 

Consists of 28, 854 vertices and 1,180, 816 edges, found in Table 1 of paper above.

**Fig. 3.** The complete protein homology map. A layout of the entire protein homology map; a total of 11,516 connected sets containing 111,604 proteins (vertices) with 1,912,684 edges. The largest connected set is shown more clearly in the inset and is enlarged further in [Figure 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283604004851?via%3Dihub#FIG4).
