# Chess Games

Note: The data used in the literature focuses on the 200 most common openings. These are all sequences of 6 moves  and are topologically equivalent. 
Origin Notes: 20,058 chess openings from games in a database of played online chess games. The authors of “Sequence Braiding: Visual Overviews of Temporal Event Sequences and Attributes” collected the dataset online from the data science platform kaggle. The dataset was collected by user Mitchell J and collects data from the chess website Lichess.org.

> 200 Chess openings displayed with Sequence Braiding. Each line represents a sequence of moves of the white player, each group is a chess piece type. Most openings start with a pawn, and very little with the knight.

**Fig. 7.** 200 Chess openings displayed with Sequence Braiding. Each line represents a sequence of moves of the white player, each group is a chess piece type. Most openings start with a pawn, and very little with the knight. After moving a pawn, it is common to move a knight or a pawn, it is a little less common to move a bishop, and only a little number of openings move the queen on the second move.
