### Descriptions from Literature

From “An efficient Framework for Generating Storyline Visualizations from Streaming Data”:

> The datasets we used for this study were the three movie datasets (Star Wars, The Matrix, and Inception) [25] which have been used in previous research as benchmark datasets for measuring layout legibilities. Star Wars consists of 14 entities and 200 time steps. The Matrix consists of 14 entities and 100 time steps. Inception consists of 8 entities and 490 time steps.

From “Design Considerations for Optimizing Storyline Visualizations” (origin paper):

> The basic form of the data applied in this visualization is simply a chronological list of interactions between various characters. These interactions between characters can be separated into a series of interaction sessions, each session representing the time span of a set of interacting characters.
More precisely, we define an interaction session as a unit which holds three attributes:
• initiation time,
• duration, and
• members.
Initiation time corresponds to the time when the interaction session begins. Duration corresponds to the duration of the interaction session. Members corresponds to the set of characters involved in the interaction session. Each interaction session represents a time slot in the data where its members are interacting. Note that any change in the formation of members (e.g., a character leaving or joining) indicates a separate interaction session.
