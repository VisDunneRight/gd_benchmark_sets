## Description from Literature

From [A Treemap Based Method for Rapid Layout of Large Graphs](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4475481):

> The other graphs used in this paper are: a graph of network scans, which is a complete graph with edge weights between 0 and 1, but for clarity, edges with weights less than a certain threshold are not shown (Figures 3 and 4, |V|=878,|E|=385003, [19]), a small artificial graph of a grid topology (Figure 5, |V|=16,|E|=24), a large graph of streets in the San Francisco Bay Area (Figure 7, |V|=321,270,|E|=800,172, [8]).
> 

From [Rapid Graph Layout Using Space Filling Curves:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658143)

> Finally, the “usafla” dataset (shown in Figure 7) is of the intersections and the streets between them in the state of Florida

**Fig. 7.** Scalability. Our approach can scale to large graphs. This graph
is of the streets in the state of Florida, |V| = 1,070,376,|E| = 2,712,798
One small region is expanded to show detail.
