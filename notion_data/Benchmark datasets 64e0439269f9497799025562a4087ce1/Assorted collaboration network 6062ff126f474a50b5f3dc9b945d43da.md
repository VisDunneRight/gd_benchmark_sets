# InfoVis Publication Data

### Description from papers

From “[Drawing Dynamic Graphs Without Timeslices](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_31)”

> *InfoVis Co-Authorship (Discrete):* a co-authorship network for papers published in the InfoVis conference from 1995 to 2015 [[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_31#ref-CR1)]. Authors collaborating on a paper are connected in a clique at the time of publication of the paper. Note this is not a cumulative network as authors can appear, disappear, and appear again. The data is of discrete nature with exactly 21 timeslices (one per year).

From **********TODO********** 

> The data has a relatively complex collection pipeline that involved both a manual and automatic approach. Information is mainly extracted from the pdf proceedings and double-checked with information from the IEEEXplore library. Where discrepancies occur we manually check the printed or electronic proceedings and add information by hand. We extract the deduped full author names from the [DBLP](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdblp.uni-trier.de%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2Bv58AClUga76UYK2CUFvT) using an author's "primary name" as stored in this database (e.g. authors who changed their last name will appear with their new name even on older papers).  Citation data is extracted from [Aminer](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aminer.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0_XIUdhVpIDg_HEBugiiWM) and [CrossRef](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crossref.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw2hclnSbjPCwMBn3PVMNxdn) and internal citations are calculated following a reference extraction from the pdf files using [Grobid](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkermitt2%2Fgrobid&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3955y7xEsjt0tRduV8rPbg).

## Descriptions from the Literature

From [ChordLink: A New Hybrid Visualization Model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35802-0_22)

> The second case study considers co-authorship networks extracted from the DBLP dataset [[30](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35802-0_22#ref-CR30)], which contains publication data in computer science. Through a query consisting of keywords and Boolean operators, one can retrieve a set of publications on a desired topic. We use the results returned by DBLP to construct networks where nodes are authors and edges indicate co-authorships, weighted by the number of papers shared by their end-nodes. Nodes are labeled with authors’ names and edges with the titles of the corresponding publications. 
We performed the query “network AND visualization” and limited to 500 the number of search results (i.e., publications) to be returned. The resulting network consists of 1766 nodes, 3780 edges, and 382 connected components. The largest of these components contains 118 nodes and 322 edges.

**Fig. 1.** A CHORDLINK visualization of a co-authorship network. The drawing has four clusters, represented as chord diagrams. In each chord diagram, circular arcs of the same color are copies of the same author. For example, in the smallest cluster, F. Montecchiani has two (green) copies, each connected to some nodes external to the cluster.

InfoVis Co-Authorship (Discrete): a co-authorship network for papers published

in the InfoVis conference from 1995 to 2015 [1]. Authors collaborating on a paper

are connected in a clique at the time of publication of the paper. Note this is

not a cumulative network as authors can appear, disappear, and appear again.

The data is of discrete nature with exactly 21 timeslices (one per year).
