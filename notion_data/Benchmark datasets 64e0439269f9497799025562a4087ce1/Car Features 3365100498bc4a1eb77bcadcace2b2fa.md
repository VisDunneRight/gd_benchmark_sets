### Descriptions from Literature

From “[DICON: Interactive Visual Analysis of Multidimensional Clusters](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.188)”:

> We applied DICON to a cars dataset which has also been used to evaluate both parallel coordinates (PCP) and scatter plot matrices (SPM) (see Fig. 8(a) and (b)). The cars dataset contains 407 cars described by 7 different dimensions from which we selected 5 quantitative dimensions as features. The two remaining dimensions, year and origin, were used as additional attributes.
