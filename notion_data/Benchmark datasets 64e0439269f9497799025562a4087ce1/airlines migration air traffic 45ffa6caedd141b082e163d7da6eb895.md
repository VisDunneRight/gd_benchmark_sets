**Fig. 1.** Edge bundling of the migrations dataset. (a) Straight line drawing. (b) Force-directed edge bundling aggregates edges well, but overaggregates at the centre of the drawing making it difficult to see patterns in the east-west flow (red bundle). (c) Cubu has a similar drawback at the centre of the map to a lesser degree. (d) Winding roads divides this structure into several smaller flows, but they may not be necessarily related to graph structure. (e) Edge-path bundling is able to distinguish between several flows that reflect paths in the underlvina graph. (f) When edae direction is considered, the alaorithm is able to further subdivide these flows based on direction.

**Fig. 8.** Airlines (undirected). (a) Input drawing. (b) Force-directed bundling is able to cluster edges into the major flows, but some overaggregation prevents details from being visualised. (c) Cubu provides a good bundling, but also has overaggregation. (c) Confluent drawings can be imposed on the layout, but as the approach cannot layout the graph bicliques can be distantly located, resulting in suboptimal performance. (e) Winding roads divides the flows into many streams, but these streams can be unfaithful to graph structure. (f) Edge-path bundling aggregates edges using weighted paths. The four prominent bundle intersections on the east coast correspond to major airports: atlanta, detroit, minneapolis, and dallas.

**Fig. 10.** Results of four algorithms on the air traffic network. (a) Force-directed bundling is able to recover the major trajectories but does not strongly bundle the network. (b) Cubu strongly bundles the main flows of airtraffic, but can suffer from overaggregation. (c) Winding roads divides the traffic into many smaller bundles, but this may not be reflective of underlying graph structure. (d) With edge-path bundling, each bundle necessarily reflects a path in the network. There are separate flows across the atlantic and asia that correspond to paths through the network.
