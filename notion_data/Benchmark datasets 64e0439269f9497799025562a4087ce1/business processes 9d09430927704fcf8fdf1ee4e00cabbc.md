Origin Notes: Paper collects various graphs from a colleciton of sources. All links in the supplemental materials from original supplemental materials are broken. A few of these datasets are from interanltional business process intellignece challenges, and others are specific processes from compains in a certain domain (hospital, road traffic management, pay processes, etc.)
