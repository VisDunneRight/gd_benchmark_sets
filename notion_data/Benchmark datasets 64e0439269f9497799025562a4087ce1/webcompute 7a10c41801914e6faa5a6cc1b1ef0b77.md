(is this KnownCR?) some of the datasets are here: [https://tcs.uos.de/doku.php?id=research/cr](https://tcs.uos.de/doku.php?id=research/cr)

Paper attached to his dataset provides no visuliaztion of the graph, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11443](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11443) also uses the dataset and provides no visualizations of the graphs themselves
