### Statistics

![four_in_one.svg](WebCompute%207a10c41801914e6faa5a6cc1b1ef0b77/four_in_one.svg)

Paper attached to his dataset provides no visuliaztion of the graph, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11443](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11443) also uses the dataset and provides no visualizations of the graphs themselves
