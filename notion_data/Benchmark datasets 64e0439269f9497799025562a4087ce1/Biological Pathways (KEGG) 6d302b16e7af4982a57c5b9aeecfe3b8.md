# Biological Pathways (KEGG)

Note: The pathway data is separated by module, but the individual modules can be combined into a large graph as visualized at https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map01100
Origin Notes: According to https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map01100, “the KEGG PATHWAY database is a collection of manually drawn graphical diagrams, called KEGG pathway maps, for metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, pathways involved in various cellular processes and organismal systems, and perturbed pathways associated with human diseases.”
graph features handled: clusters, directed edges, large, partition
Graph features in papers: categorical nodes,clusters (pre-existing),labeled nodes

### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Multi-Level Area Balancing of Clustered Graphs](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3038154)”:

> KEGG Overview Pathway. Fig. 6 is the result of reproducing the KEGG overview pathway map using our approach. The color coding of the category here is directly retrieved from the original KEGG database [43], as similarly incorporated in Metabopolis [64] (see figures in supplementary materials, available online). We also set the same threshold for specifying unimportant vertices as in Metabopolis, so that readers can refer to the paper for comparison (Fig. 6). The advantage of this technique allows us to arrange the vertexts in a balanced fashion by pushing vertexts away from each other. This initially gives users an idea of how big each category is, and explicitly shows which reaction is classified under which category. Users can also identify sub-components effectively since those components with identical topological structures are aligned as neighbors. This also helps users to comprehend which structures are associated with certain types of pathways, such as small chains, stars, etc.
