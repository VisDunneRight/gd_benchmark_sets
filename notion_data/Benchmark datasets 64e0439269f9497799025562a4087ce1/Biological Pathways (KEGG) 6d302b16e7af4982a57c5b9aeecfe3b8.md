# Biological Pathways (KEGG)

Note: The pathway data is separated by module, but the individual modules can be combined into a large graph as visualized at https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map01100
Origin Notes: According to https://www.kegg.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map01100, “the KEGG PATHWAY database is a collection of manually drawn graphical diagrams, called KEGG pathway maps, for metabolic pathways, signaling pathways, pathways involved in various cellular processes and organismal systems, and perturbed pathways associated with human diseases.”
graph features handled: clusters, directed edges, large, partition
Graph features in papers: categorical nodes,clusters (pre-existing),labeled nodes
