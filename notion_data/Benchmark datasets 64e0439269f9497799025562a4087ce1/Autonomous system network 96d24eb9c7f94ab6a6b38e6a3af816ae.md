## Descriptions from Literature

From “[Preserving Minority Structures in Graph Sampling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222065)”

> The AS-733 graph data set [48] is an autonomous systems network on the Internet with 6,474 nodes and 13,895 edges. The original graph and samples obtained by RDN, SST, MCGS are shown in Figure 5.

From “[Graphs over time: densification laws, shrinking diameters and possible explanations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1081870.1081893)”

> The graph of routers comprising the Internet can be organized into sub-graphs called Autonomous Systems (AS). Each AS exchanges traffic flows with some neighbors (peers).
We can construct a communication network of who-talks-towhom from the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) logs. We use the the Autonomous Systems (AS) dataset from [26]. The dataset contains 735 daily instances which span an interval of 785 days from November 8 1997 to January 2 2000.In contrast to citation networks, where nodes and edges only get added (not deleted) over time, the AS dataset also exhibits both the addition and deletion of the nodes and edges over time.
