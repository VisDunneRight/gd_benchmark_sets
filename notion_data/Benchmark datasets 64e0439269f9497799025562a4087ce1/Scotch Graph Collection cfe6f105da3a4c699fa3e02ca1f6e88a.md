Note: The SCOTCH software package is produced by the SCOTCH project whose goal is to study static mapping by the means of graph theory, using a â€œdivide and conquer'' approach.
The SCOTCH software package for static mapping embodies all the algorithms and graph bipartitioning heuristics developed within the SCOTCH project.

Origin Notes: Collection consisting of graphs from various sources including topological meshes, meshes related to physicla problems (fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, combinatorial optimization), and interprocess communicaiton graphs for a parallel computing implementation of a factorization solver. 
Collected from Steve Hammond, the Harwell-Boeing Collection, Bruce Hendrickson, and Horst Simon.

			===========================

			The SCOTCH graph collection

			===========================

The graphs that comprise this collection have been gathered from various
sites and people (Steve Hammond, the Harwell-Boeing collection, Bruce
Hendrickson, and Horst Simon). They are all stored in SCOTCH source graph
format (.src), and are accompanied with their geometry file (.xyz) whenever
available.

This directory contains:

ar_*		: Architecture graphs for classical topologies, mostly meshes.

fe_*		: Triangular and quadrangular unstructured meshes related to
		  fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, or combinatorial
		  optimization problems.

nd_*		: Valuated interprocess communication graphs issued from a
		  parallel implementation of a sparse block Cholesky
		  factorization solver, which represent partitions of the
		  unknowns induced by a nested dissection method.
		  The nd_ref0, nd_ref1, nd_ref2, nd_ref3, and nd_ref4 graphs
		  are aliases for the nd_2047.7750, nd_2453.47659,
		  nd_2815.84406, nd_3093.105713, and nd_3470.135148 graphs,
		  respectively.
