## Descriptions from the Literature

From [ChordLink: A New Hybrid Visualization Model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35802-0_22)

> The second case study considers co-authorship networks extracted from the DBLP dataset [[30](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35802-0_22#ref-CR30)], which contains publication data in computer science. Through a query consisting of keywords and Boolean operators, one can retrieve a set of publications on a desired topic. We use the results returned by DBLP to construct networks where nodes are authors and edges indicate co-authorships, weighted by the number of papers shared by their end-nodes. Nodes are labeled with authors’ names and edges with the titles of the corresponding publications. 
We performed the query “network AND visualization” and limited to 500 the number of search results (i.e., publications) to be returned. The resulting network consists of 1766 nodes, 3780 edges, and 382 connected components. The largest of these components contains 118 nodes and 322 edges.

In each chord diagram, circular arcs of the same color are copies of the same author. For example, in the smallest cluster, F. Montecchiani has two (green) copies, each connected to some nodes external to the cluster.
