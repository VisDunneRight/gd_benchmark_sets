Note: Refer to the https://mathgenealogy.org/contact.php for the data, which consists of doctoral graduates in mathematics and some adjacent fields, alongside properties like the degree granting institution and tittle of thesis. Entries also have relations based on advisors.

### Description from Literature

From “[Visualizing Evolving Trees](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22203-0_23)”:

> **The Mathematics Genealogy:** shows advisor-advisee relationships in the world of mathematics, stretching back to the middle ages [[36](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22203-0_23#ref-CR36)]. The dataset includes the thesis titles, students, advisors, dates, and number of descendants. The total number of nodes is around 260,000 and is continuously updated. While this data is not quite a tree (or even connected, or planar), we extract a subset to create a tree with 500 nodes. The maximum node degree of this tree is 5 and the radius is 14.

It is non-planar because multiple advisors can advise the same person or a person can have multiple advisors! Infact, there is a K3,3 in it

In July 2016, Cosmin Ionita and Pat Quillen of 
MathWorks used MATLAB to analyze the Math Genealogy Project graph. At 
the time, the genealogy graph contained 200,037 vertices. There were 
7639 (3.8%) isolated vertices and 1962 components of size two 
(advisor-advisee pairs where we have no information about the advisor). 
The largest component of the genealogy graph contained 180,094 vertices,
 accounting for 90% of all vertices in the graph. The main component has
 7323 root vertices (individuals with no advisor) and 137,155 leaves 
(mathematicians with no students), accounting for 76.2% of the vertices 
in this component. The next largest component sizes were 81, 50, 47, 34,
 34, 33, 31, 31, and 30.
For historical comparisonn, we also have data from June 2010, when 
Professor David Joyner of the United States Naval Academy asked for data
 from our database to analyze it as a graph. At the time, the genealogy 
graph had 142,688 vertices. Of these, 7,190 were isolated vertices (5% 
of the total). The largest component had 121,424 vertices (85% of the 
total number). The next largest component had 128 vertices. The next 
largest component sizes were 79, 61, 45, and 42. The most frequent size 
of a nontrivial component was 2; there were 1937 components of size 2. 
The component with 121,424 vertices had 4,639 root verticies, i.e., 
mathematicians for whom the advisor is currently unknown.

The Mathematics Genealogy Project graph is nonplanar. Thanks to 
Professor Ezra Brown of Virginia Tech for assisting in finding the 
subdivision of *K*3,3 depicted below. The green vertices
 form one color class and the yellow ones form the other. Interestingly,
 Gauß is the only vertex that needs to be connected by paths with more 
than one edge.
