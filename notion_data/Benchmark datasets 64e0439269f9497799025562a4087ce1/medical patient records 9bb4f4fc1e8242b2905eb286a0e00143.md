### Description from Literature

From “[DICON: Interactive Visual Analysis of Multidimensional Clusters](https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.188)”:

> We also applied DICON within the healthcare domain to visualize a dataset containing more than 10,000 patient records. The data includes claims, labs, pharmacy, and patient profile information. To augment this data, we applied a patient similarity algorithm to compute patient similarity scores across multiple dimensions (e.g., diagnoses, lab results, etc.). We also indexed the patient records to make the data searchable.
