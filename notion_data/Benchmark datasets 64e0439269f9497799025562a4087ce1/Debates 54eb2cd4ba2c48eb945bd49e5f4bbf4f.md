### Description from Literature

From “[NEREx: Named-Entity Relationship Exploration in Multi-Party Conversations](https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13181)”:

> In order to explore the relations between entities, we use a distance-restricted model for creating entity-pairs. As described in Section 2, prior work considers relations between entities either as semantic relations based on linguistic knowledge or regards two entities as related due to their presence in the same document. The often ungrammatical structure of utterances in verbatim text transcripts (including non-standard lexical items, syntactic patterns, interruptions, repetitions, and crosstalk) requires a simple extralinguistic model. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a model that bounds the scope in which we consider two entities to be related, using a distance threshold (*maxDist*). Our method creates a pair of entities if the entities appear in the same sentences within *maxDist* words of one another.
> 

> However, not only are frequent entity-pairs important, but also pairs that are semantically similar (e.g., *cut $5 trillion*, *cut $4 trillion*). These often present opposing speaker opinions about a given topic. To maximize the chance that entity-pairs represent true semantic relations, we set the default value of *maxDist* to a low value (5 words). To vary the granularity of the analysis, the parameter can be changed interactively depending on the analysis task and data. Nevertheless, some infrequent longer-distance entity-pairs are discovered which do not represent salient relations. To reduce their impact, we calculate the average observed distance (in words) for each entity pair. We use both frequency and average distance in the visualization to reflect the strength of the entity-pair.
