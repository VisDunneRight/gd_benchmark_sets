# RandDAG

Added in paper: No
Appeared in years: 1
Cleaned ALL data: No
Graph features in papers: 1
In repo?: Yes
Note: Uniformly sampled from set of level graphs with certain graph parameters, such as number of nodes and number of edges. 
Origin Notes: http://graphdrawing.org highlights the DAGmar graph generator, and privdes a benchmark set of randomly generated directed acyclic graphs which they mention was generated from the collections they mention earlier.

## Descriptions from the Literature

From [Aesthetic Discrimination of Graph Layouts](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04414-5_12):

> We have assembled such a dataset using two types of sources. First, we used the collections of the well-known graph archives ROME, NORTH and RANDDAG which are published on [graphdrawing.org](http://www.graphdrawing.org/) as well as the NIST’s “Matrix Market” [[2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04414-5_12#ref-CR2)].

=== STOP RENDERING ===

Might be same as DAGmar graphs? looked at internet archive to see what the GD data website looked like in 2018 and there is no mention of RAndDAG as a thing, but there are the randomly generated DAGs which makes sense tto believe it is those.
