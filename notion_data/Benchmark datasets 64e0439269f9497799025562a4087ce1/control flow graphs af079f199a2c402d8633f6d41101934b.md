### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Node Overlap Removal by Growing a Tree](https://dx.doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00442)”:

> Our data includes the same set of graphs that was used by the authors of
PRISM to compare it with other algorithms [6]. The set is available in the
Graphviz open source package.
