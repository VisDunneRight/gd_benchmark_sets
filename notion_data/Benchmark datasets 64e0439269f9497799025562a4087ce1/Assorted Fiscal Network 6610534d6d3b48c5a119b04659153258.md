Note: The dataset is implied to be internal, with nodes corresponding to individual tax payers and the authors mentioning anonymizing data themselves for security reasons.

## Descriptions from the Literature

From “[CHORDLINK: A New Hybrid Visualization Model](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35802-0_22)”:

> We considered a real network of taxpayers and their economic transactions. The network is provided by the IRV (Italian Revenue Agency) and refers to a portion of data for the fiscal year 2014, consisting of 174 subjects with high fiscal risk and 200 economic transactions between them [[11](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-35802-0_22#ref-CR11)].

From “[A visual analytics system to support tax evasion discovery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923618300563?via%3Dihub#s0015)”:

> The data sources queried by the IRV officers are modeled in TaxNet as a unified network *G*. Each node *v* of *G* is a single taxpayer, which can be either an individual or a legal person, like a private company or a public institution. Many attributes are associated with *v*, including the type of economic activity, the geographic location and territorial scope, the declared income, the amount of VAT credits/debts and of VAT refunded/paid, and the amount of economic exchange within the European Union. The edges of *G* are directed edges. An edge (*u*,*v*) can model different types of relationships between *u* and *v*.
