# Protein Interactions (Publications)

Note: Various types of protein interaction graphs are recorded in other network collections. We highlight two of them from the surveyed papers. First, we have the temporal Protein Interaction Publications, showing the history of how protein interactions were described in the literature. Second, the Protein Homology graph was provided by the Large Graph Layout project, their links are now broken and the dataset lost.  Nonetheless, http://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/index.html and http://konect.cc/networks/ both also have various dataset of human/other species protein interactions. 
Origin Notes: Protein Interaction Publications were collected from the biological Pathway Commons Database: http://www.pathwaycommons.org/.

### Description from the Literature

From [TimeArcs: Visualizing Fluctuations in Dynamic Networks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.12882):

> The data contains the publication information (such as publication year, author, and textual evidence) of interactions between pairs of proteins, as well as their specific interaction type.
> 

> When there are multiple arcs connecting two proteins, it falls into one of the two circumstances. If they have the same color, these arcs indicate that there are supporting evidences in different publications which *confirm* the interaction between two elements. On the other hand, if they have the different colors, the more recent appearance provides either more detailed knowledge about the interaction or shows a *conflict* between different articles regarding the way in which these proteins interact.

**Fig. 10**: TimeArcs visualization for interactions around PCAF protein. (1), (2), and (3) in the figure are supporting evidences in literature of “PCAF binds MAML”. 

## Protein Homology (Lost)

### Description from the Literature

From [Rapid Graph Layout Using Space Filling Curves:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4658143\)

> The “pgraph” dataset (shown in Figures 2 and 6) is a protein homology graph, which is relatively dense [7].
> 

Consists of 28, 854 vertices and 1,180, 816 edges, found in Table 1 of paper above.

The largest connected set is shown more clearly in the inset and is enlarged further in [Figure 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283604004851?via%3Dihub#FIG4).
