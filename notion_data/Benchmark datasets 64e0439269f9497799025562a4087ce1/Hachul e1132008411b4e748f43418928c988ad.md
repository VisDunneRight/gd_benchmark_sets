# Hachul

Note: Eades et al. refer to a “Hachul Library” without citation. Hachul likely refers to Stefan Hachul, author of “Drawing Large Graphs with a Potential-Field-Based Multilevel Algorithm”, which Eades et al. cite. The graphs used in this paper, however, are “the graphs contained in the graph partitioning archive of C. Walshaw… and the biggest graphs from the AT&T graph collection”.
