From [Drawing Big Graphs Using Spectral
Sparsification](https://www.notion.so/Drawing-Big-Graphs-Using-Spectral-Sparsification-e5d3efdca48541f2b1789ec74357ebf6) : 

this consists of RNA sequence graphs that are used for the

analysis of repetitive sequences in sequencing data; these graphs have been used

in previous experiments. 

They are locally dense and globally sparse, and gener-

ally have distinctive shapes.

Graph properties are provided in Table 1. The set of graphs can be downloaded from

http://wcl.ml.unisa.edu.au/graph-untangling/graphs.zip. All graphs have

high local density, and a sparse global structure that allows to create layouts far from hair-

balls that are showing the structure well
