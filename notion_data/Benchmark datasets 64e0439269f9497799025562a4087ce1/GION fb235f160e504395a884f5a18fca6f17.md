### Descriptions from Literature

From [Drawing Big Graphs Using Spectral Sparsification](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73915-1_22):

> this consists of RNA sequence graphs that are used for the analysis of repetitive sequences in sequencing data; these graphs have been used in previous experiments. They are locally dense and globally sparse, and generally have distinctive shapes.
> 

From [GION: Interactively Untangling Large Graphs on Wall-Sized Displays](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-45803-7_10):

> Graph properties are provided in Table 1. The set of graphs can be downloaded from http://wcl.ml.unisa.edu.au/graph-untangling/graphs.zip. All graphs have high local density, and a sparse global structure that allows to create layouts far from hairballs that are showing the structure well.
