### Description from Literature

From [**Visualizing Evolving Trees](https://www.notion.so/Visualizing-Evolving-Trees-95d3552ad36746f4a3e3614cd1c1f561?pvs=21):**

> **The Tree of Life:** captures the evolutionary progression of life on Earth [[37](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22203-0_23#ref-CR37)]. The underlying data is a tree structure with a natural time component. As a new species evolves, a new node in the tree is added. The edges give the parent-child relation of the nodes, where the parent is the original species, and the child is the new species. We use a subset of this graph with 500 nodes. The maximum node degree of this tree is 5, and the radius is 24
