### Descriptions from Literature

From “[Node Overlap Removal by Growing a Tree](https://doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00442)”:

> Our data includes the same set of graphs that was used by the authors of PRISM to compare it with other algorithms [6]. The dataset is available in the Graphviz open source package.
> 

From “[Optimal k-level planarization and crossing minimization](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-18469-7_22)”:

> The first set of graphs are all the hierarchical network diagrams appearing in the GraphViz gallery [3]… Table 1 shows the results of minimizing edge crossings and maximizing planar subgraphs with MIP and SAT solvers, as well as the crossings resulting in the Graphviz heuristic layout for graphs from the GraphViz gallery.
