InfoVis Co-Authorship (Discrete): a co-authorship network for papers published
in the InfoVis conference from 1995 to 2015 [1]. Authors collaborating on a paper
are connected in a clique at the time of publication of the paper. Note this is
not a cumulative network as authors can appear, disappear, and appear again.
The data is of discrete nature with exactly 21 timeslices (one per year).
Van De Bunt (Discrete): shows the relationships between 32 freshmen at
seven different time points. A discrete dynamic graph is built using the method
of Brandes et al. [9], with an undirected edge inserted into a timeslice if the
participants reciprocally report “best friendship” or “friendship” at that time.
Newcomb Fraternity Data (Discrete): contains the sociometric preference of
17 members of a fraternity in the University of Michigan in the fall of 1956 [39].
As in previous work [9], at each timeslice, we inserted undirected edges connect-
ing students to their three best friends.
Rugby (Continuous): is a network derived from over 3,000 tweets involving
teams in the Guinness Pro12 rugby competition. The tweets were posted between
09.01.2014 and 10.23.2015. Each tweet contains information about the involved
teams and the time of publication with a precision down to the second.
Pride and Prejudice (Continuous): lists the dialogues between characters in
the novel Pride and Prejudice in order [29]. The book has 61 chapters and the
data set includes over 4,000 interactions between characters.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-73915-1.pdf,2017,"algorithm, comparison",5,GD 2017,,5

Sugiyama implementation in order to obtain layerings with the Longest-Path

as test instances. Thus, we compiled two collections of 30,061 instances and
57,300 instances, respectively. For each instance, we applied 10 random shuffles
of the northern and southern layers, each followed by a MEDIAN-ordered run
as explained above. So we ran a total of 601,220 and 1,146,000 instances of the
