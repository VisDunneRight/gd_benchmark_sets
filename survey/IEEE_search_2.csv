Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064996","Information visualization;user interfaces;toolkits;2D graphics.","Data visualization;Cascading style sheets;Image color analysis;Debugging;Information analysis","computer animation;data visualisation;document handling;user interfaces;Web sites","data-driven documents;representation-transparent approach;Web visualization;toolkit-specific abstraction;native representation;standard document object model;document elements;dynamic transforms;representational transparency;animation;scene graph","","1628","13","41","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346248","Austrian Science Fund (J 3437-N15) the Air Force Research Laboratory and DARPA(grant numbers:FA8750-12-C-0300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876017","Sets;set visualization;sets intersections;set attributes;set relationships;multidimensional data","Data visualization;Visualization;Power generation;Sorting;Information analysis","combinatorial mathematics;data visualisation;duality (mathematics);Internet;mathematics computing;matrix algebra;public domain software;set theory;sorting","visualization community;combinatorial explosion;set intersection visualization;UpSet;quantitative set analysis;task-driven aggregates;duality;matrix layout;associated data representation;summary statistics;subset attributes;element attributes;task-driven analysis;queries;groupings;advanced visual encodings;Web-based approach;open source approach","Computer Graphics;Databases, Factual;Informatics","826","","29","OAPA","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Relations are given between items, and a hierarchy is defined on the items as well. We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4015425","Network visualization;edge bundling;edge aggregation;edge concentration;curves;graph visualization;tree visualization;node-link diagrams;hierarchies;treemaps.","Data visualization;Tree graphs;Wires;Cables;Spline;Software systems;Social network services;Displays;Tree data structures","curve fitting;data visualisation;splines (mathematics);tree data structures;trees (mathematics)","hierarchical edge bundles;adjacency relation visualization;hierarchical data;compound graph;tree visualization method;B-spline curve;visual clutter","","567","18","33","IEEE","20 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Edgebreaker: connectivity compression for triangle meshes","J. Rossignac","Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","6 Aug 2002","1999","5","1","47","61","Edgebreaker is a simple scheme for compressing the triangle/vertex incidence graphs (sometimes called connectivity or topology) of three-dimensional triangle meshes. Edgebreaker improves upon the storage required by previously reported schemes, most of which can guarantee only an O(t log(t)) storage cost for the incidence graph of a mesh of t triangles. Edgebreaker requires at most 2t bits for any mesh homeomorphic to a sphere and supports fully general meshes by using additional storage per handle and hole. For large meshes, entropy coding yields less than 1.5 bits per triangle. Edgebreaker's compression and decompression processes perform identical traversals of the mesh from one triangle to an adjacent one. At each stage, compression produces an op-code describing the topological relation between the current triangle and the boundary of the remaining part of the mesh. Decompression uses these op-codes to reconstruct the entire incidence graph. Because Edgebreaker's compression and decompression are independent of the vertex locations, they may be combined with a variety of vertex-compressing techniques that exploit topological information about the mesh to better estimate vertex locations. Edgebreaker may be used to compress the connectivity of an entire mesh bounding a 3D polyhedron or the connectivity of a triangulated surface patch whose boundary need not be encoded. The paper also offers a comparative survey of the rapidly growing field of geometric compression.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.764870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=764870","","Computer graphics;Solid modeling;Costs;Application software;Topology;Entropy coding;Computer architecture;Petroleum;Computational modeling;Analytical models","solid modelling;data compression;computational geometry;mesh generation;graph theory","Edgebreaker;connectivity compression;triangle meshes;triangle-vertex incidence graphs;topology;storage cost;entropy coding;geometric compression;decompression;vertex locations;vertex-compressing techniques;3D polyhedron;triangulated surface patch;3D models;solid modelling","","363","11","41","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376154","Network visualization;Matrix visualization;Hybrid visualization;Aggregation;Interaction.","Layout;Color;Animation;Matrix converters;Sparse matrices;Aggregates","data structures;data visualisation;matrix algebra;social sciences computing","NodeTrix visualization;social networks hybrid visualization;hardware capabilities;hybrid representation;adjacency matrices;interaction techniques;dragging selections;InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Models, Theoretical;Social Support;User-Computer Interface","306","5","35","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a ""video see through"" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. In this paper, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634325","Augmented reality;virtual visual servoing;robust estimators;real-time;model-based tracking;model-free tracking.","Augmented reality;Visual servoing;Robustness;Layout;Delay;Costs;Real time systems;Machine vision;Cameras;Robust control","computational geometry;image motion analysis;augmented reality;tracking;object detection;image sequences;least squares approximations","real-time markerless tracking;3D model-free augmented reality;virtual visual servoing framework;3D model-based tracking algorithm;monocular vision system;virtual objects;point-to-curves interaction matrices;3D geometrical primitives;M-estimator;visual control law;image sequences","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Systems;Feedback;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","305","14","55","","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In human cognition, understanding and memorability are intertwined. As a first step towards being able to ask questions about impact and effectiveness, here we ask: 'What makes a visualization memorable?' We ran the largest scale visualization study to date using 2,070 single-panel visualizations, categorized with visualization type (e.g., bar chart, line graph, etc.), collected from news media sites, government reports, scientific journals, and infographic sources. Each visualization was annotated with additional attributes, including ratings for data-ink ratios and visual densities. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we collected memorability scores for hundreds of these visualizations, and discovered that observers are consistent in which visualizations they find memorable and forgettable. We find intuitive results (e.g., attributes like color and the inclusion of a human recognizable object enhance memorability) and less intuitive results (e.g., common graphs are less memorable than unique visualization types). Altogether our findings suggest that quantifying memorability is a general metric of the utility of information, an essential step towards determining how to design effective visualizations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634103","Data visualization;Taxonomy;Information technology;Encoding;memorability;Visualization taxonomy;information visualization","Data visualization;Taxonomy;Information technology;Encoding","data visualisation","visualization community;data understanding;visualization type;news media sites;government reports;scientific journals;infographic sources;data-ink ratios;visual densities;Amazon;Mechanical Turk;memorability scores","Artificial Intelligence;Cues;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Memory;Pattern Recognition, Visual;Task Performance and Analysis;User-Computer Interface","261","1","39","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous work on trajectory visualization addresses selected aspects of this problem, but not all of them. We present a novel approach to visualizing trajectory attribute data. Our solution covers space, time, and attribute values. Based on an analysis of relevant visualization tasks, we designed the visualization solution around the principle of stacking trajectory bands. The core of our approach is a hybrid 2D/3D display. A 2D map serves as a reference for the spatial context, and the trajectories are visualized as stacked 3D trajectory bands along which attribute values are encoded by color. Time is integrated through appropriate ordering of bands and through a dynamic query mechanism that feeds temporally aggregated information to a circular time display. An additional 2D time graph shows temporal information in full detail by stacking 2D trajectory bands. Our solution is equipped with analytical and interactive mechanisms for selecting and ordering of trajectories, and adjusting the color mapping, as well as coordinated highlighting and dedicated 3D navigation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel visualization by three examples related to radiation surveillance, traffic analysis, and maritime navigation. User feedback obtained in a small experiment indicates that our hybrid 2D/3D solution can be operated quite well.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327262","Visualization;interaction;exploratory analysis;trajectory attribute data;spatio-temporal data","Trajectory;Data visualization;Image color analysis;Navigation","cartography;data visualisation;geographic information systems;solid modelling","stacking-based visualization;trajectory attribute data;spatio-temporal context;trajectory visualization;stacked 3D trajectory band;2D-3D display;2D map;spatial context;dynamic query mechanism;2D time graph;color mapping;3D navigation;radiation surveillance;traffic analysis;maritime navigation","","195","","35","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to maintain the spatial rights of the primary data relation, we avoid layout adjustment techniques that improve set cluster continuity and density. Instead, we use a continuous, possibly concave, isocontour to delineate set membership, without disrupting the primary layout. Optimizations minimize cluster overlap and provide for calculation of the isocontours at interactive speeds.

Lab., CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","7 Nov 2002","2002","8","3","239","254","We describe a general framework for out-of-core rendering and management of massive terrain surfaces. The two key components of this framework are: view-dependent refinement of the terrain mesh and a simple scheme for organizing the terrain data to improve coherence and reduce the number of paging events from external storage to main memory. Similar to several previously proposed methods for view-dependent refinement, we recursively subdivide a triangle mesh defined over regularly gridded data using longest-edge bisection. As part of this single, per-frame refinement pass, we perform triangle stripping, view frustum culling, and smooth blending of geometry using geomorphing. Meanwhile, our refinement framework supports a large class of error metrics, is highly competitive in terms of rendering performance, and is surprisingly simple to implement. Independent of our refinement algorithm, we also describe several data layout techniques for providing coherent access to the terrain data. By reordering the data in a manner that is more consistent with our recursive access pattern, we show that visualization of gigabyte-size data sets can be realized even on low-end, commodity PCs without the need for complicated and explicit data paging techniques. Rather, by virtue of dramatic improvements in multilevel cache coherence, we rely on the built-in paging mechanisms of the operating system to perform this task. The end result is a straightforward, simple-to-implement, pointerless indexing scheme that dramatically improves the data locality and paging performance over conventional matrix-based layouts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2002.1021577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021577","","Data visualization;Geometry;Operating systems;Large-scale systems;Organizing;Personal communication networks;Indexing;Refining;Defense industry;Toy industry","data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics);computational geometry;cache storage;paged storage;operating systems (computers);quadtrees;geography","terrain simplification;view-dependent out-of-core visualization;out-of-core rendering;quadtree;massive terrain surfaces;terrain mesh refinement;paging events;longest-edge bisection;triangle stripping;view frustum culling;smooth blending;geometry;geomorphing;error metrics;data layout techniques;commodity personal computer;multilevel cache coherence;operating system;indexing","","165","8","35","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The data sets used in this experiment were derived from standard benchmark data sets of the information visualization community. We found that small multiples gave significantly faster performance than animation overall and for each of our five graph comprehension tasks. In addition, small multiples had significantly more errors than animation for the tasks of determining sets of nodes or edges added to the graph during the same timeslice, although a positive time-error correlation coefficient suggests that, in this case, faster responses did not lead to more errors. This result suggests that, for these two tasks, animation is preferable if accuracy is more important than speed. Preserving the mental map under either the animation or the small multiples condition had little influence in terms of error rate and response time.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473226","Dynamic graph drawing;small multiples;animation;mental map preservation;evaluation.","Animation;Heuristic algorithms;Data visualization;Human computer interaction;Benchmark testing;Error analysis;Delay;Algorithm design and analysis;Shape;Displays","computer animation;data visualisation;human computer interaction","human-computer interaction;mental map preservation effect;dynamic graphs animation;small multiples presentation;information visualization community;time-error correlation coefficient","","150","1","34","","27 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Are certain attributes correlated spatially or temporally? Are there trends or outliers in the data? Answering these questions requires aggregation over arbitrary regions of the domain and attributes of the data. Many relational databases implement the well-known data cube aggregation operation, which in a sense precomputes every possible aggregate query over the database. Data cubes are sometimes assumed to take a prohibitively large amount of space, and to consequently require disk storage. In contrast, we show how to construct a data cube that fits in a modern laptop's main memory, even for billions of entries; we call this data structure a nanocube. We present algorithms to compute and query a nanocube, and show how it can be used to generate well-known visual encodings such as heatmaps, histograms, and parallel coordinate plots. When compared to exact visualizations created by scanning an entire dataset, nanocube plots have bounded screen error across a variety of scales, thanks to a hierarchical structure in space and time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on a variety of real-world datasets, and present memory, timing, and network bandwidth measurements.

In this paper, we propose a two-way coupled simulation framework that uses the particle level set method to efficiently model dense liquid volumes and a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method to simulate diffuse regions such as sprays. Our novel SPH method allows us to simulate both dense and diffuse water volumes, fully incorporates the particles that are automatically generated by the particle level set method in under-resolved regions, and allows for two-way mixing between dense SPH volumes and grid-based liquid representations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4459322","Animation;Physically based modeling;Animation;Physically based modeling","Level set;Spraying;Navier-Stokes equations;Hydrodynamics;Particle tracking;Finite element methods;Mesh generation;Layout;Animation","computational fluid dynamics;flow simulation;hydrodynamics;sprays","particle level set fluid simulation;grid-based methods;adaptive methods;two-way coupled simulation framework;dense liquid volumes;smoothed particle hydrodynamics method;two-way mixing","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Models, Theoretical;Motion;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Rheology;User-Computer Interface","149","6","52","","3 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such geographically embedded networks (graphs) are usually very large. For example, the county-to-county migration data in the U.S. has thousands of counties and about a million migration paths. Moreover, many variables are associated with each flow, such as the number of migrants for different age groups, income levels, and occupations. It is a challenging task to visualize such data and discover network structures, multivariate relations, and their geographic patterns simultaneously. This paper addresses these challenges by developing an integrated interactive visualization framework that consists three coupled components: (1) a spatially constrained graph partitioning method that can construct a hierarchy of geographical regions (communities), where there are more flows or connections within regions than across regions; (2) a multivariate clustering and visualization method to detect and present multivariate patterns in the aggregated region-to-region flows; and (3) a highly interactive flow mapping component to map both flow and multivariate patterns in the geographic space, at different hierarchical levels. The proposed approach can process relatively large data sets and effectively discover and visualize major flow structures and multivariate relations at the same time. User interactions are supported to facilitate the understanding of both an overview and detailed patterns.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290710","hierarchical clustering;graph partitioning;flow mapping;spatial interaction;contiguity constraints;multidimensional visualization;coordinated views;data mining","Data visualization;Humans;Diseases;Multidimensional systems;Data mining;Earth;Decision making;Demography;Urban planning;Transportation","cartography;data visualisation;user interfaces","multivariate visualization;large spatial interaction data;weighted location-to-location network;county-to-county migration data;integrated interactive visualization framework;spatially constrained graph partitioning method;multivariate clustering;interactive flow mapping;geographic space","","148","3","43","","23 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the previously proposed methods, our method can measure a radiance distribution of a real scene automatically and use it for superimposing virtual objects appropriately onto a real scene. First, a geometric model of the scene is constructed from a pair of omnidirectional images by using an omnidirectional stereo algorithm. Then, radiance of the scene is computed from a sequence of omnidirectional images taken with different shutter speeds and mapped onto the constructed geometric model. The radiance distribution mapped onto the geometric model is used for rendering virtual objects superimposed onto the scene image. As a result, even for a complex radiance distribution, our method can superimpose virtual objects with convincing shadings and shadows cast onto the real scene. We successfully tested the proposed method by using real images to show its effectiveness.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.764865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=764865","","Layout;Lighting;Augmented reality;Solid modeling;Stereo vision;Computer graphics;Computer vision;Geometry;Rendering (computer graphics);Testing","augmented reality;brightness;computational geometry;stereo image processing;image sequences;rendering (computer graphics)","radiance distribution;virtual objects;real scene;geometric model;omnidirectional images;omnidirectional stereo algorithm;image sequences;shutter speeds;rendering;shadows;computer vision;augmented reality","","142","18","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Parallel Sets are a new method for the visualization and interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations and, thus, to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a metalevel, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization.

Moreover, such sequences often result in measurable outcomes (e.g., life or death, win or loss). Collections of event sequences can be aggregated together to form event progression pathways. These pathways can then be connected with outcomes to model how alternative chains of events may lead to different results. This paper describes the Outflow visualization technique, designed to (1) aggregate multiple event sequences, (2) display the aggregate pathways through different event states with timing and cardinality, (3) summarize the pathways' corresponding outcomes, and (4) allow users to explore external factors that correlate with specific pathway state transitions. Results from a user study with twelve participants show that users were able to learn how to use Outflow easily with limited training and perform a range of tasks both accurately and rapidly.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327272","Outflow;information visualization;temporal event sequences;state diagram;state transition","Data visualization;Information analysis;Sequential analysis;Layout;Image color analysis","data visualisation","temporal event sequence;event sequence data;electronic medical record;EMR;sports event;event progression pathway;outflow visualization technique;aggregate pathway;event state;cardinality;pathway state transition","Computer Graphics;Heart Failure;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Theoretical;Soccer;Surveys and Questionnaires;Time Factors;User-Computer Interface","136","13","35","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Microblogging communities, such as Twitter, are increasingly used as digital backchannels for timely exchange of brief comments and impressions during political speeches, sport competitions, natural disasters, and other large events. Currently, shared updates are typically displayed in the form of a simple list, making it difficult to get an overview of the fast-paced discussions as it happens in the moment and how it evolves over time. In contrast, our Visual Backchannel design provides an evolving, interactive, and multi-faceted visual overview of large-scale ongoing conversations on Twitter. To visualize a continuously updating information stream, we include visual saliency for what is happening now and what has just happened, set in the context of the evolving conversation. As part of a fully web-based coordinated-view system we introduce Topic Streams, a temporally adjustable stacked graph visualizing topics over time, a People Spiral representing participants and their activity, and an Image Cloud encoding the popularity of event photos by size. Together with a post listing, these mutually linked views support cross-filtering along topics, participants, and time ranges. We discuss our design considerations, in particular with respect to evolving visualizations of dynamically changing data. Initial feedback indicates significant interest and suggests several unanticipated uses.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613451","backchannel;information visualization;events;multiple views;microblogging;information retrieval;World Wide Web","Visualization;Twitter;Data visualization;Shape;Context;Real time systems;Streaming media","data visualisation;information filtering;interactive systems;social networking (online)","visual backchannel;online conversation;large-scale event;microblogging community;Twitter;digital backchannel;political speech;sport competition;natural disaster;interactive visual overview;multifaceted visual overview;information stream visualization;visual saliency;Web-based coordinated-view system;Topic Streams;graph visualization;People Spiral;image cloud encoding;information retrieval;cross-filtering;data visualization","","132","3","43","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our system emphasizes large-scale curvilinear features (ridges and valleys) because such features are the dominant visual elements in most terrains. Both the example height field and user's sketch map are analyzed using a technique from the field of geomorphology. The system finds patches from the example data that match the features found in the user's sketch. Patches are joined together using graph cuts and Poisson editing. The order in which patches are placed in the synthesized terrain is determined by breadth-first traversal of a feature tree and this generates improved results over standard raster-scan placement orders.

In contrast to the traditional approaches of precomputing a fixed number of level-of-detail representations for a given object, our approach involves statically generating a continuous level-of-detail representation for the object. This representation is then used at run time to guide the selection of appropriate triangles for display. The list of displayed triangles is updated incrementally from one frame to the next. Our approach is more effective than the current level-of-detail-based rendering approaches for most scientific visualization applications, where there are a limited number of highly complex objects that stay relatively close to the viewer.

These concepts and relations are related through an ontology (also known as a schema). OntoVis is named such because it uses information in the ontology associated with a social network to semantically prune a large, heterogeneous network.

This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest, and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find patterns across different link types using a matrix overview.

Mobility data sets characterize the variation of the presence of people in different places over time as well as movements (or flows) of people between the places. The analysis of mobility data is challenging due to the need to analyze and compare spatial situations (i.e., presence and flows of people at certain time moments) and to gain an understanding of the spatio-temporal changes (variations of situations over time). Traditional flow visualizations usually fail due to massive clutter. Modern approaches offer limited support for investigating the complex variation of the movements over longer time periods. We propose a visual analytics methodology that solves these issues by combined spatial and temporal simplifications. We have developed a graph-based method, called MobilityGraphs, which reveals movement patterns that were occluded in flow maps. Our method enables the visual representation of the spatio-temporal variation of movements for long time series of spatial situations originally containing a large number of intersecting flows. The interactive system supports data exploration from various perspectives and at various levels of detail by interactive setting of clustering parameters. The feasibility our approach was tested on aggregated mobility data derived from a set of geolocated Twitter posts within the Greater London city area and mobile phone call data records in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

This provides valuable data for researchers and practitioners in many application domains, such as marketing, to inform decision-making. Distilling valuable social signals from the huge crowd's messages, however, is challenging, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic crowd behaviors. The challenge is rooted in data analysts' capability of discerning the anomalous information behaviors, such as the spreading of rumors or misinformation, from the rest that are more conventional patterns, such as popular topics and newsworthy events, in a timely fashion. FluxFlow incorporates advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, and offers a set of novel visualization designs for presenting the detected threads for deeper analysis. We evaluated FluxFlow with real datasets containing the Twitter feeds captured during significant events such as Hurricane Sandy.

To reduce the severity of the restrictions imposed by limited physical area, we introduce ""impossible spaces,"" a new design mechanic for virtual environments that wish to maximize the size of the virtual environment that can be explored with natural locomotion. Such environments make use of self-overlapping architectural layouts, effectively compressing comparatively large interior environments into smaller physical areas. We conducted two formal user studies to explore the perception and experience of impossible spaces. In the first experiment, we showed that reasonably small virtual rooms may overlap by as much as 56% before users begin to detect that they are in an impossible space, and that the larger virtual rooms that expanded to maximally fill our available 9.14m Ã 9.14m workspace may overlap by up to 31%. Our results also demonstrate that users perceive distances to objects in adjacent overlapping rooms as if the overall space was uncompressed, even at overlap levels that were overtly noticeable. In our second experiment, we combined several well-known redirection techniques to string together a chain of impossible spaces in an expansive outdoor scene. We then conducted an exploratory analysis of users' verbal feedback during exploration, which indicated that impossible spaces provide an even more powerful illusion when users are naive to the manipulation.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165136","Virtual environments;perception;spatial illusions;redirection.","Virtual environments;Legged locomotion;Buildings;Educational institutions;Estimation;Layout;Space exploration","feedback;gait analysis;human computer interaction;virtual reality","natural walking;self-overlapping architectural layout;immersive virtual environment;user physical workspace;impossible spaces;design mechanic;natural locomotion;virtual room;adjacent overlapping room;redirection technique;expansive outdoor scene;users verbal feedback;illusion","Adult;Architecture as Topic;Computer Graphics;Distance Perception;Environment;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Motion Sickness;Space Perception;User-Computer Interface;Walking;Young Adult","114","2","31","","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The graphs are drawn side-byside from left to right as a sequence of narrow stripes that are placed perpendicular to the horizontal time line. The hierarchically organized vertices of the graphs are arranged on vertical, parallel lines that bound the stripes; directed edges connect these vertices from left to right. To address massive overplotting of edges in huge graphs, we employ a splatting approach that transforms the edges to a pixel-based scalar field. This field represents the edge densities in a scalable way and is depicted by non-linear color mapping. The visualization method is complemented by interaction techniques that support data exploration by aggregation, filtering, brushing, and selective data zooming. Furthermore, we formalize graph patterns so that they can be interactively highlighted on demand. A case study on software releases explores the evolution of call graphs extracted from the JUnit open source software project. In a second application, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach by applying it to a bibliography dataset containing more than 1.5 million paper titles from 60 years of research history producing a vast amount of relations between title words.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065001","Dynamic graph visualization;graph splatting;software visualization;software evolution.","Graphics;Image edge detection;Data visualization;Encoding;Image color analysis;Software engineering","data visualisation;graph theory","parallel edge splatting;scalable dynamic graph visualization;node-link diagram;nonlinear color mapping;interaction technique;data exploration;selective data zooming;call graph;JUnit open source software project;bibliography dataset","","112","1","40","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system is built on a new visualization-centric opinion mining technique that considers uncertainty for faithfully modeling and analyzing customer opinions. A new visual representation is developed to convey customer opinions by augmenting well-established scatterplots and radial visualization. To provide multiple-level exploration, we introduce subjective logic to handle and organize subjective opinions with degrees of uncertainty.

Modern data visualization problems in the domains of news analysis, network security and financial applications, require visual analysis of incremental data, which poses specific challenges that are normally not solved by static visualizations. The incremental nature of the data implies that visualizations have to necessarily change their content and still provide comprehensible representations. In particular, in this paper we deal with the need to keep an eye on recent events together with providing a context on the past and to make relevant patterns accessible at any scale. Our technique adapts to the incoming data by taking care of the rate at which data items occur and by using a decay function to let the items fade away according to their relevance. Since access to details is also important, we also provide a novel distortion magnifying lens technique which takes into account the distortions introduced by the logarithmic time scale to augment readability in selected areas of interest. We demonstrate the validity of our techniques by applying them on incremental data coming from online news streams in different time frames.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065010","Incremental visualization;event based data;lens distortion.","Time series analysis;Data visualization;Lenses;Estimation;Event detection","computer displays;data analysis;data structures;data visualisation;financial management;information resources;Internet;security of data;time series","CloudLines;event episode compact display;multiple time series visualization technique;interactive distortion;time-based representation;data analysis;network security;financial service;temporal context;data visualization;decay function;magnifying lens technique;logarithmic time scale;readability enhancement;incremental data sets;online news streams","","107","3","30","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

During both work and leisure, we increasingly interact with information spaces that contain multiple facets and relations, such as authors, keywords, and citations of academic publications, or actors and genres of movies. To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to âtake a strollâ through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries.

Inspired by the information diffusion model and the theory of selective exposure, we develop an opinion diffusion model to approximate opinion propagation among Twitter users. Accordingly, we design an opinion flow visualization that combines a Sankey graph with a tailored density map in one view to visually convey diffusion of opinions among many users. A stacked tree is used to allow analysts to select topics of interest at different levels.

This problem is important because AR system developers need to both place graphics in arbitrary spatial relationships with real-world objects, and to know that users will perceive them in the same relationships. Furthermore, AR makes possible enhanced perceptual techniques that have no real-world equivalent, such as x-ray vision, where AR users are supposed to perceive graphics as being located behind opaque surfaces. This paper reviews and discusses protocols for measuring egocentric depth judgments in both virtual and augmented environments, and discusses the well-known problem of depth underestimation in virtual environments. It then describes two experiments that measured egocentric depth judgments in AR. Experiment I used a perceptual matching protocol to measure AR depth judgments at medium and far-field distances of 5 to 45 meters. The experiment studied the effects of upper versus lower visual field location, the x-ray vision condition, and practice on the task. The experimental findings include evidence for a switch in bias, from underestimating to overestimating the distance of AR-presented graphics, at ~ 23 meters, as well as a quantification of how much more difficult the x-ray vision condition makes the task. Experiment II used blind walking and verbal report protocols to measure AR depth judgments at distances of 3 to 7 meters. The experiment examined real-world objects, real-world objects seen through the AR display, virtual objects, and combined real and virtual objects. The results give evidence that the egocentric depth of AR objects is underestimated at these distances, but to a lesser degree than has previously been found for most virtual reality environments. The results are consistent with previous studies that have implicated a restricted field-of-view, combined with an inability for observers to scan the ground plane in a near-to-far direction, as explanations for the observed depth underestimation.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.1035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7573294","Artificial;augmented;and virtual realities;ergonomics;evaluation/methodology;screen design;experimentation;measurement;performance;depth perception;optical see-through augmented reality.","Observers;Legged locomotion;Augmented reality;Visualization;Optical variables measurement","","","Computer Graphics;Depth Perception;Humans;User-Computer Interface","105","","","","22 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A special graph is created to store and manifest real traffic information recorded by taxi trajectories over city streets. It conveys urban transportation dynamics which can be discovered by applying graph analysis algorithms. To support interactive, multiscale visual analytics, a graph partitioning algorithm is applied to create region-level graphs which have smaller size than the original street-level graph. Graph centralities, including Pagerank and betweenness, are computed to characterize the time-varying importance of different urban regions. The centralities are visualized by three coordinated views including a node-link graph view, a map view and a temporal information view. Users can interactively examine the importance of streets to discover and assess city traffic patterns. We have implemented a fully working prototype of this approach and evaluated it using massive taxi trajectories of Shenzhen, China. TrajGraph's capability in revealing the importance of city streets was evaluated by comparing the calculated centralities with the subjective evaluations from a group of drivers in Shenzhen. Feedback from a domain expert was collected. The effectiveness of the visual interface was evaluated through a formal user study.

The presented focus+context approach removes or suppresses less important parts of a scene to reveal more important underlying information. However, less important parts are fully visible in those regions, where important visual information is not lost, i.e., more relevant features are not occluded. Features within the volumetric data are first classified according to a new dimension, denoted as object importance. This property determines which structures should be readily discernible and which structures are less important. Next, for each feature, various representations (levels of sparseness) from a dense to a sparse depiction are defined. Levels of sparseness define a spectrum of optical properties or rendering styles. The resulting image is generated by ray-casting and combining the intersected features proportional to their importance (importance compositing). The paper includes an extended discussion on several possible schemes for levels of sparseness specification. Furthermore, different approaches to importance compositing are treated.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432686","Index Terms- View-dependent visualization;volume rendering;focus+context techniques;level-of-detail techniques;illustrative techniques.","Data visualization;Medical diagnostic imaging;Liver neoplasms;Lesions;Focusing;Biomedical optical imaging;Biomedical imaging;Rendering (computer graphics);Shape;Layout","feature extraction;data visualisation;hidden feature removal;rendering (computer graphics);ray tracing;visual databases","importance-driven feature enhancement;volume visualization;focus-context approach;ray-casting;sparseness specification","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Biological;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Online Systems;Pattern Recognition, Automated;User-Computer Interface","102","8","29","","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a design study of a novel set visual representation, LineSets, consisting of a curve connecting all of the set's elements. Our approach to design the visualization differs from traditional methodology used by the InfoVis community. We first explored the potential of the visualization concept by running a controlled experiment comparing our design sketches to results from the state-of-the-art technique. Our results demonstrated that LineSets are advantageous for certain tasks when compared to concave shapes.

The approach formulates the storyline layout as a novel hybrid optimization approach that combines discrete and continuous optimization. The discrete method generates an initial layout through the ordering and alignment of entities, and the continuous method optimizes the initial layout to produce the optimal one.

We guarantee the resulting surface representation to be closed and oriented, defined by a valid triangulation of the surface of the body, which in turn is presented as a collection of tetrahedra. The entire surface is ""wrapped"" by a collection of triangles, which form a graph structure, and where each triangle is contained within a single tetrahedron. The representation is similar to the homology theory that uses simplices embedded in a manifold to define a closed curve within each tetrahedron. We introduce data structures based upon a new encoding of the tetrahedra that are at least four times more compact than the standard data structures using vertices and triangles. For parallel computing and improved cache performance, the vertex information is stored local to the tetrahedra. We can distribute the vertices in such a way that no tetrahedron ever contains more than one vertex, We give methods to evaluate surface curvatures and principal directions at each vertex, whenever these quantities are defined. Finally, we outline a method for simplifying the surface, that is reducing the vertex count while preserving the geometry. We compare the characteristics of our methods with an 8-cell based method, and show results of surface extractions from CT-scans and MR-scans at full resolution.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.485620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=485620","","Data structures;Data mining;Isosurfaces;Testing;Encoding;Parallel processing;Geometry;Surgery","computational geometry;interpolation;image representation;data structures;data visualisation","triangulated surface extraction;tetrahedral decomposition;digitized volumetric data;surface representation;isosurfaces;interpolation;Marching Cubes algorithm;tetrahedra;triangulation;graph structure;data structures;parallel computing;cache performance;surface curvatures;geometry;surface extraction;CT-scans;MR-scans;full resolution","","99","6","34","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The paper extends the use of FFDs to a dynamic setting. Our goal is to enable normally inanimate graphics objects, such as teapots and tables, to become animated, and learn to move about in a charming, cartoon like manner. To achieve this goal, we implement a system that can transform a wide class of objects into dynamic characters. Our formulation is based on parameterized hierarchical FFDs augmented with Lagrangian dynamics, and provides an efficient way to animate and control the simulated characters. Objects are assigned mass distributions and elastic deformation properties, which allow them to translate, rotate, and deform according to internal and external forces. In addition, we implement an automated optimization process that searches for suitable control strategies. The primary contributions of the work are threefold. First, we formulate a dynamic generalization of conventional, geometric FFDs. The formulation employs deformation modes which are tailored by the user and are expressed in terms of FFDs. Second, the formulation accommodates a hierarchy of dynamic FFDs that can be used to model local as well as global deformations. Third, the deformation modes can be active, thereby producing locomotion.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.620488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=620488","","Animation;Deformable models;Automatic control;Lattices;Electrical capacitance tomography;Lagrangian functions;Computer graphics;Solid modeling;Shape control;Layout","computer animation;computational geometry;digital simulation;elastic deformation","dynamic free form deformations;animation synthesis;keyframe animation;Lagrangian dynamics;normally inanimate graphics objects;dynamic characters;parameterized hierarchical FFDs;simulated characters;mass distributions;elastic deformation properties;automated optimization process;control strategies;dynamic generalization;deformation modes;dynamic FFDs;global deformations;locomotion","","97","6","27","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our system provides an overview+detail interface of game phases, and their aggregation into a series of connected visualizations, each visualization being tailored for actions such as a series of passes or a goal attempt. To evaluate our tool, we ran two qualitative user studies on recent games using SoccerStories with data from one of the world's leading live sports data providers. The first study resulted in a series of four articles on soccer tactics, by a tactics analyst, who said he would not have been able to write these otherwise.

This paper describes our investigations into the use of sparsely-distributed discrete, opaque texture as an artistic device for more explicitly indicating the relative depth of a transparent surface and for communicating the essential features of its 3D shape in an intuitively meaningful and minimally occluding way. The driving application for this work is the visualization of layered surfaces in radiation therapy treatment planning data, and the technique is illustrated on transparent isointensity surfaces of radiation dose. We describe the perceptual motivation and artistic inspiration for defining a stroke texture that is locally oriented in the direction of greatest normal curvature (and in which individual strokes are of a length proportional to the magnitude of the curvature in the direction they indicate), and we discuss two alternative methods for applying this texture to isointensity surfaces defined in a volume. We propose an experimental paradigm for objectively measuring observers' ability to judge the shape and depth of a layered transparent surface, in the course of a task which is relevant to the needs of radiotherapy treatment planning, and use this paradigm to evaluate the practical effectiveness of our approach through a controlled observer experiment based on images generated from actual clinical data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.597794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=597794","","Surface texture;Surface treatment;Shape control;Biomedical applications of radiation;Surface reconstruction;Shape measurement;Layout;Optical refraction;Cancer;Rendering (computer graphics)","transparency;image texture;radiation therapy;medical image processing;mathematical morphology;rendering (computer graphics);data visualisation;art","3D shape;smoothly curving transparent surfaces;sparsely-distributed discrete opaque texture;multiple overlapping surfaces;rendering;depth distance;artistic device;relative depth;minimal occlusion;layered surface visualization;radiation therapy treatment planning data;transparent isointensity surfaces;radiation dose;shape perception;stroke texture;normal curvature;observers' ability;radiotherapy;clinical data;depth perception;shape representation;principal direction texture","","95","2","61","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here we propose a novel visualization design, âWhisperâ, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters. Initial feedback from domain experts suggests promising use for today's information consumption and dispersion in the wild.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327271","Information visualization;information diffusion;contagion;Social media;microblogging;spatiotemporal patterns","Media;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Diffusion processes;Twitter;Social network services","data mining;data visualisation;social networking (online)","Whisper;spatiotemporal process;information diffusion;social media;Twitter;visualization design;temporal trend;social-spatial extent;sunflower metaphor;spatial hierarchical layout;flux line-drawing algorithm;temporal pattern;spatial pattern;focused diffusion series","Computer Graphics;Information Dissemination;Software;Spatio-Temporal Analysis;User-Computer Interface","94","1","54","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While evidence exists that narrative sequencing in traditional stories can affect comprehension and memory, little is known about how sequencing choices affect narrative visualization. We consider the forms and reactions to sequencing in narrative visualization presentations to provide a deeper understanding with a focus on linear, 'slideshow-style' presentations. We conduct a qualitative analysis of 42 professional narrative visualizations to gain empirical knowledge on the forms that structure and sequence take. Based on the results of this study we propose a graph-driven approach for automatically identifying effective sequences in a set of visualizations to be presented linearly. Our approach identifies possible transitions in a visualization set and prioritizes local (visualization-to-visualization) transitions based on an objective function that minimizes the cost of transitions from the audience perspective. We conduct two studies to validate this function. We also expand the approach with additional knowledge of user preferences for different types of local transitions and the effects of global sequencing strategies on memory, preference, and comprehension. Our results include a relative ranking of types of visualization transitions by the audience perspective and support for memory and subjective rating benefits of visualization sequences that use parallelism as a structural device. We discuss how these insights can guide the design of narrative visualization and systems that support optimization of visualization sequence.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634182","Data visualization;Sequential analysis;Parallel processing;Encoding;Linear programming;narrative structure;Data storytelling;narrative visualization","Data visualization;Sequential analysis;Parallel processing;Encoding;Linear programming","cognition;data visualisation;graph theory;humanities;sequences","narrative sequencing;slideshow-style presentations;qualitative analysis;professional narrative visualizations;graph-driven approach;automatic effective sequence identification;visualization set;local transitions;visualization-to-visualization transitions;audience perspective;user preferences;global sequencing strategies;visualization sequence optimization;narrative systems","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Comprehension;Computer Graphics;Humans;Multimodal Imaging;Narration;Pattern Recognition, Visual;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface;Visual Perception","93","","37","IEEE","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Venn and Euler style diagrams are a common visual representation of such set membership where the data elements are represented by labels or glyphs and sets are indicated by boundaries surrounding their members. Generating such diagrams automatically such that set regions do not intersect unless the corresponding sets have a non-empty intersection is a difficult problem. Further, it may be impossible in some cases if regions are required to be continuous and convex. Several approaches exist to draw such set regions using more complex shapes, however, the resulting diagrams can be difficult to interpret. In this paper we present two novel approaches for simplifying a complex collection of intersecting sets into a strict hierarchy that can be more easily automatically arranged and drawn (Figure 1). In the first approach, we use compact rectangular shapes for drawing each set, attempting to improve the readability of the set intersections. In the second approach, we avoid drawing intersecting set regions by duplicating elements belonging to multiple sets. We compared both of our techniques to the traditional non-convex region technique using five readability tasks. Our results show that the compact rectangular shapes technique was often preferred by experimental subjects even though the use of duplications dramatically improves the accuracy and performance time for most of our tasks.

These devices potentially represent an affordable alternative to the more traditional, centralised CAVE-style immersive environments. One driver for the development of CAVE-style immersive environments has been collaborative sense-making. Despite this, there has been little research on the effectiveness of collaborative visualisation in CAVE-style facilities, especially with respect to abstract data visualisation tasks. Indeed, very few studies have focused on the use of these displays to explore and analyse abstract data such as networks and there have been no formal user studies investigating collaborative visualisation of abstract data in immersive environments. In this paper we present the results of the first such study. It explores the relative merits of HMD and CAVE-style immersive environments for collaborative analysis of network connectivity, a common and important task involving abstract data. We find significant differences between the two conditions in task completion time and the physical movements of the participants within the space: participants using the HMD were faster while the CAVE2 condition introduced an asymmetry in movement between collaborators. Otherwise, affordances for collaborative data analysis offered by the low-cost HMD condition were not found to be different for accuracy and communication with the CAVE2. These results are notable, given that the latest HMDs will soon be accessible (in terms of cost and potentially ubiquity) to a massive audience.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7539620","Oculus Rift;CAVE;Immersive Analytics;Collaboration;3D Network","Collaboration;Data visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization;Two dimensional displays;Virtual reality;Navigation","data analysis;data visualisation;helmet mounted displays;virtual reality","immersive collaborative analysis;head-mounted display;high-quality immersive display technologies;low-cost HMD condition;centralised CAVE-style immersive environments;collaborative visualisation;CAVE-style facilities;abstract data visualisation tasks;network connectivity collaborative analysis;task completion time;CAVE2 condition;collaborative data analysis","","89","","41","IEEE","10 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While currently ignored by most visualization models, this translation entails a loss of information and the introduction of a number of artifacts that can be useful, (e.g., aggregation, structures) or distracting (e.g., over-plotting, clutter) for the analysis. This phenomenon is observed in parallel coordinates, where overlapping lines between adjacent axes form distinct patterns, representing the relation between variables they connect. However, even for a small number of dimensions, the challenge is to effectively convey the relationships for all combinations of dimensions. The size of the dataset and a large number of dimensions only add to the complexity of this problem. To address these issues, we propose Pargnostics, parallel coordinates diagnostics, a model based on screen-space metrics that quantify the different visual structures. Pargnostics metrics are calculated for pairs of axes and take into account the resolution of the display as well as potential axis inversions. Metrics include the number of line crossings, crossing angles, convergence, overplotting, etc. To construct a visualization view, the user can pick from a ranked display showing pairs of coordinate axes and the structures between them, or examine all possible combinations of axes at once in a matrix display. Picking the best axes layout is an NP-complete problem in general, but we provide a way of automatically optimizing the display according to the user's preferences based on our metrics and model.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613439","Parallel Coordinates;metrics;display optimization;visualization models.","Measurement;Data visualization;Histograms;Clutter;Optimization;Visualization;Pixel","computational complexity;data visualisation;interactive programming;matrix algebra;parallel programming;program diagnostics","pargnostics;screen-space metrics;interactive visualization;screen space;parallel coordinates diagnostics;matrix display;NP-complete problem","","88","","32","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These laser scanner systems, however, yield an enormous amount of irregular and scattered digitized point data that requires intensive reconstruction processing. Reconstruction of freeform objects consists of two main stages: parameterization and surface fitting. Selection of an appropriate parameterization is essential for topology reconstruction as well as surface fitness. Current parameterization methods have topological problems that lead to undesired surface fitting results, such as noisy self-intersecting surfaces. Such problems are particularly common with concave shapes whose parametric grid is self-intersecting, resulting in a fitted surface that considerably twists and changes its original shape. In such cases, other parameterization approaches should be used in order to guarantee non-self-intersecting behavior. The parameterization method described in this paper is based on two stages: 2D initial parameterization; and 3D adaptive parameterization. Two methods were developed for the first stage: partial differential equation (PDE) parameterization and neural network self organizing maps (SOM) parameterization. The Gradient Descent Algorithm (GDA) and Random Surface Error Correction (RSEC), both of which are iterative surface fitting methods, were developed and implemented.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.910817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910817","","Scattering parameters;Surface fitting;Surface reconstruction;Shape;Reverse engineering;Topology;Noise shaping;Partial differential equations;Neural networks;Self organizing feature maps","image reconstruction;surface fitting;partial differential equations;self-organising feature maps;iterative methods;solid modelling;computational geometry","2D initial parameterization;3D scattered points;neural network;freeform object reconstruction;surface fitting;topology reconstruction;noisy self-intersecting surfaces;3D adaptive parameterization;partial differential equation parameterization;self organizing maps;Gradient Descent Algorithm;Random Surface Error Correction;iterative methods;solid modeling","","87","2","24","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a challenging problem in network visualization to automatically draw appealing metro maps. There are two aspects to this problem that depend on each other: the layout problem of finding station and link coordinates and the labeling problem of placing nonoverlapping station labels. In this paper, we present a new integral approach that solves the combined layout and labeling problem (each of which, independently, is known to be NP-hard) using mixed-integer programming (MIP). We identify seven design rules used in most real-world metro maps. We split these rules into hard and soft constraints and translate them into an MIP model. Our MIP formulation finds a metro map that satisfies all hard constraints (if such a drawing exists) and minimizes a weighted sum of costs that correspond to the soft constraints. We have implemented the MIP model and present a case study and the results of an expert assessment to evaluate the performance of our approach in comparison to both manually designed official maps and results of previous layout methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.81","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473229","Network visualization;graph drawing;graph labeling;metro map;octilinear layout;mixed-integer programming.","Labeling;Navigation;Visualization;Network topology;Costs;Urban areas;Geography;Space stations;Information geometry","cartography;computational complexity;data visualisation;integer programming","high quality metro maps drawing;high quality metro maps labeling;mixed integer programming;public transport networks;visual aids;route planning;navigation tasks;network visualization;NP hard","","86","1","39","IEEE","27 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To uncover exploration strategies, we examined fixation points, duration, and saccades of participants' gaze trajectories. For the non-radial diagrams, we additionally investigated the effect of diagram orientation by switching the position of the root node to each of the four main orientations. We also recorded and analyzed correctness of answers as well as completion times in addition to the eye movement data.

This approach involves a new method for origin-destination flow density estimation and a new method for flow map generalization, which together can remove spurious data variance, normalize flows with control population, and detect high-level patterns that are not discernable with existing approaches. The approach achieves three main objectives in addressing the challenges for analyzing and mapping massive flow data. First, it removes the effect of size differences among spatial units via kernel-based density estimation, which produces a measurement of flow volume between each pair of origin and destination. Second, it extracts major flow patterns in massive flow data through a new flow sampling method, which filters out duplicate information in the smoothed flows. Third, it enables effective flow mapping and allows intuitive perception of flow patterns among origins and destinations without bundling or altering flow paths. The approach can work with both point-based flow data (such as taxi trips with GPS locations) and area-based flow data (such as county-to-county migration). Moreover, the approach can be used to detect and compare flow patterns at different scales or in relatively sparse flow datasets, such as migration for each age group.

Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines.

As a result, advanced visualization and data analysis are also becoming an integral part of the scientific process. Often, a key step in extracting insight from these large simulations involves the definition, extraction, and evaluation of features in the space and time coordinates of the solution. However, in many applications, these features involve a range of parameters and decisions that will affect the quality and direction of the analysis. Examples include particular level sets of a specific scalar field, or local inequalities between derived quantities. A critical step in the analysis is to understand how these arbitrary parameters/decisions impact the statistical properties of the features, since such a characterization will help to evaluate the conclusions of the analysis as a whole. We present a new topological framework that in a single-pass extracts and encodes entire families of possible features definitions as well as their statistical properties. For each time step we construct a hierarchical merge tree a highly compact, yet flexible feature representation. While this data structure is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the raw simulation data it allows us to extract a set of features for any given parameter selection in a postprocessing step. Furthermore, we augment the trees with additional attributes making it possible to gather a large number of useful global, local, as well as conditional statistic that would otherwise be extremely difficult to compile. We also use this representation to create tracking graphs that describe the temporal evolution of the features over time. Our system provides a linked-view interface to explore the time-evolution of the graph interactively alongside the segmentation, thus making it possible to perform extensive data analysis in a very efficient manner.

The key idea behind our approach is to exploit a tree cut to approximate each tree and allow users to interactively modify the tree cuts based on their interests. In particular, we propose an incremental evolutionary tree cut algorithm with the goal of balancing 1) the fitness of each tree cut and the smoothness between adjacent tree cuts; 2) the historical and new information related to user interests. A time-based visualization is designed to illustrate the evolving topics over time. To preserve the mental map, we develop a stable layout algorithm. As a result, our approach can quickly guide users to progressively gain profound insights into evolving hierarchical topics. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and real-world news data. The results show that users are able to successfully analyze evolving topics in text data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875938","Hierarchical topic visualization;evolutionary tree clustering;data transformation","Document handling;Text mining;Context awareness;Data visualization;Text analysis;Algorithm design and analysis","text analysis","hierarchical topics;large text corpora;topic trees sequence;document organisation;interactive visual text analysis;complex evolutionary patterns;evolutionary tree cut algorithm;tree cut;time based visualization;stable layout algorithm","Cluster Analysis;Communication;Computer Graphics;Crowdsourcing;Humans;Informatics;Task Performance and Analysis","81","","43","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automated anomaly detection based on advanced machine learning techniques has been developed to combat this issue; challenges remain, though, due to the difficulty of obtaining proper ground truth for model training and evaluation. Therefore, substantial human judgment on the automated analysis results is often required to better adjust the performance of anomaly detection. Unfortunately, techniques that allow users to understand the analysis results more efficiently, to make a confident judgment about anomalies, and to explore data in their context, are still lacking. In this paper, we propose a novel visual analysis system, TargetVue, which detects anomalous users via an unsupervised learning model and visualizes the behaviors of suspicious users in behavior-rich context through novel visualization designs and multiple coordinated contextual views. Particularly, TargetVue incorporates three new ego-centric glyphs to visually summarize a user's behaviors which effectively present the user's communication activities, features, and social interactions. An efficient layout method is proposed to place these glyphs on a triangle grid, which captures similarities among users and facilitates comparisons of behaviors of different users. We demonstrate the power of TargetVue through its application in a social bot detection challenge using Twitter data, a case study based on email records, and an interview with expert users. Our evaluation shows that TargetVue is beneficial to the detection of users with anomalous communication behaviors.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467196","U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7185421","Anomaly Detection;Social Media;Visual Analysis;Anomaly Detection;Social Media;Visual Analysis","Data visualization;Visualization;Twitter;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Context;Data models","data analysis;data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","social bot detection challenge;triangle grid;user behavior;machine learning techniques;anomaly detection;online communication system;anomalous user behavior;visual analysis system;Targetvue system","Computer Graphics;Humans;Internet;Social Behavior;Social Media;User-Computer Interface","81","","45","IEEE","11 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When viewing the treemaps side by side or back and forth, there exist several problems that can prevent viewers from performing effective comparisons. Those problems include abrupt layout changes, a lack of prominent visual patterns to represent layouts, and a lack of direct contrast to highlight differences. In this paper, we present strategies to visualize changes of hierarchical data using treemaps. A new treemap layout algorithm is presented to reduce abrupt layout changes and produce consistent visual patterns. Techniques are proposed to effectively visualize the difference and contrast between two treemap snapshots in terms of the map items' colors, sizes, and positions. Experimental data show that our algorithm can achieve a good balance in maintaining a treemap's stability, continuity, readability, and average aspect ratio. A software tool is created to compare treemaps and generate the visualizations.

To reduce clutter and improve the readability of node-link views, Holten & van Wijk's force-directed edge bundling employs a physical simulation to spatially group graph edges. While both useful and aesthetic, this technique has shortcomings: it bundles spatially proximal edges regardless of direction, weight, or graph connectivity. As a result, high-level directional edge patterns are obscured. We present divided edge bundling to tackle these shortcomings. By modifying the forces in the physical simulation, directional lanes appear as an emergent property of edge direction. By considering graph topology, we only bundle edges related by graph structure. Finally, we aggregate edge weights in bundles to enable more accurate visualization of total bundle weights. We compare visualizations created using our technique to standard force-directed edge bundling, matrix diagrams, and clustered graphs; we find that divided edge bundling leads to visualizations that are easier to interpret and reveal both familiar and previously obscured patterns.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065002","Graph visualization;aggregation;node-link diagrams;edge bundling;physical simulation.","Encoding;Graphics;Image edge detection;Data visualization","data visualisation;directed graphs;matrix algebra;pattern clustering","directional network data;node link diagram;graph theory;directed edge bundling;graph connectivity;directional edge patterns;graph topology;visualization;matrix diagrams;clustered graphs","","78","4","19","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Modeling, animating, and rendering complex scenes using volumetric textures","F. Neyret","iMAGIS, IMAG, Grenoble, France","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","6 Aug 2002","1998","4","1","55","70","Complex repetitive scenes containing forests, foliage, grass, hair, or fur, are challenging for common modeling and rendering tools. The amount of data, the tediousness of modeling and animation tasks, and the cost of realistic rendering have caused such kind of scene to see only limited use even in high-end productions. The author describes how the use of volumetric textures is well suited to such scenes. These primitives can greatly simplify modeling and animation tasks. More importantly, they can be very efficiently rendered using ray tracing with few aliasing artifacts. The main idea, initially introduced by Kajiya and Kay (1989), is to represent a pattern of 3D geometry in a reference volume, that is tiled over an underlying surface much like a regular 2D texture. In our contribution, the mapping is independent of the mesh subdivision, the pattern can contain any kind of shape, and it is prefiltered at different scales as for MIP-mapping. Although the model encoding is volumetric, the rendering method differs greatly from traditional volume rendering. A volumetric texture only exists in the neighborhood of a surface, and the repeated instances (called texels) of the reference volume are spatially deformed. Furthermore, each voxel of the reference volume contains a key feature which controls the reflectance function that represents aggregate intravoxel geometry. This allows for ray tracing of highly complex scenes with very few aliasing artifacts, using a single ray per pixel (for the part of the scene using the volumetric texture representation). The major technical considerations of our method lie in the ray-path determination and in the specification of the reflectance function.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.675652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=675652","","Animation;Layout;Ray tracing;Geometry;Surface texture;Reflectivity;Hair;Costs;Production;Shape","computer animation;rendering (computer graphics);image texture;realistic images;ray tracing;computational geometry","modeling;animation;rendering;complex scenes;volumetric textures;complex repetitive scenes;realistic rendering;ray tracing;aliasing;3D geometry;mesh subdivision;volume rendering;reflectance function;aggregate intravoxel geometry;three dimensional geometry","","78","16","28","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spatially clustering data is one effective metaphor for users to explore similarity and relationships between information, adjusting the weighting of dimensions or characteristics of the dataset to observe the change in the spatial layout. Semantic interaction is an approach to user interaction in such spatializations that couples these parametric modifications of the clustering model with users' analytic operations on the data (e.g., direct document movement in the spatialization, highlighting text, search, etc.). In this paper, we present results of a user study exploring the ability of semantic interaction in a visual analytic prototype, ForceSPIRE, to support sensemaking. We found that semantic interaction captures the analytical reasoning of the user through keyword weighting, and aids the user in co-creating a spatialization based on the user's reasoning and intuition.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327294","User Interaction;visualization;sensemaking;analytic reasoning;visual analytics","Semantics;User interfaces;Analytical models;Visual analytics;Mathematical model","data visualisation;inference mechanisms","semantic interaction;sensemaking;analytical reasoning;model steering;visual analytic tools;cognitively demanding task;mathematical models;visualization;human intuition;expressive interactions;spatially clustering data;parametric modifications;clustering model;visual analytic prototype;ForceSPIRE;keyword weighting","","76","2","36","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the field of visualization, however, the use of systematic rules embracing these aspects has received less attention. The situation is further complicated by the fact that visualization often uses semi-transparencies to reveal occluded objects, in which case the resulting color mixing effects add additional constraints to the choice of the color palette. Color design forms a crucial part in visual aesthetics. Thus, the consideration of these issues can be of great value in the emerging field of illustrative visualization. We describe a knowledge-based system that captures established color design rules into a comprehensive interactive framework, aimed to aid users in the selection of colors for scene objects and incorporating individual preferences, importance functions, and overall scene composition. Our framework also offers new knowledge and solutions for the mixing, ordering and choice of colors in the rendering of semi-transparent layers and surfaces. All design rules are evaluated via user studies, for which we extend the method of conjoint analysis to task-based testing scenarios.

We design a treemap-like icon to represent a multidimensional cluster, and the quality of the cluster can be conveniently evaluated with the embedded statistical information. We further develop a novel layout algorithm which can generate similar icons for similar clusters, making comparisons of clusters easier.

However, due to their increasing complexity, designing effective methods to visualize and explore PTS is highly challenging. Most existing techniques employ network visualization methods and focus on showing the network topology across stops while ignoring various mobility-related factors such as riding time, transfer time, waiting time, and round-the-clock patterns. This work aims to visualize and explore passenger mobility in a PTS with a family of analytical tasks based on inputs from transportation researchers. After exploring different design alternatives, we come up with an integrated solution with three visualization modules: isochrone map view for geographical information, isotime flow map view for effective temporal information comparison and manipulation, and OD-pair journey view for detailed visual analysis of mobility factors along routes between specific origin-destination pairs. The isotime flow map linearizes a flow map into a parallel isoline representation, maximizing the visualization of mobility information along the horizontal time axis while presenting clear and smooth pathways from origin to destinations. Moreover, we devise several interactive visual query methods for users to easily explore the dynamics of PTS mobility over space and time. Lastly, we also construct a PTS mobility model from millions of real passenger trajectories, and evaluate our visualization techniques with assorted case studies with the transportation researchers.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346893","Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) and ETH Zurich, the MOE Tier-2 fund (MOE2011-T2Â¿2-041 (ARC 5/12)), the MOE Tier-1 fund (RG 29/11), and the National Basic Research Program(grant numbers:2014CB340304); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876029","Mobility;public transportation;visual analytics","Transportation;Data visualization;Urban areas;Visual analytics;Schedules;Radiofrequency identification;Urban areas","data visualisation;public transport;traffic engineering computing","passenger mobility visualization;public transportation system;PTS;shared transportation services;massive transportation services;network visualization methods;network topology;mobility-related factors;isochrone map view;geographical information;isotime flow map view;temporal information;OD-pair journey view;origin-destination pair;parallel isoline representation;mobility information visualization;PTS mobility model","Computer Graphics;Geographic Information Systems;Humans;Spatio-Temporal Analysis;Transportation","74","","42","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In an iterative process, such biologists observe the reactions of living cells under various experimental conditions, view the results in the context of the interaction graph, and then propose changes to the graph model. These graphs serve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incorporates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaborators we conclude that Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658137","Index Termsâ;Graph layout;systems biology visualization;small multiples;design study","Visualization;Biological system modeling;Biological systems;Context modeling;Immune system;Collaborative tools;Displays;Performance analysis;Data analysis;Cells (biology)","biology computing;data visualisation;decision theory;graph theory;iterative methods;knowledge representation","multiple experimental condition visualization;interaction graph layout;biological system;iterative process;living cells reaction observation;dynamic knowledge representation;drawing package;data information display;design decision;cerebral tool","Biology;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Models, Biological;Proteome;Signal Transduction;Software;User-Computer Interface","73","","42","","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our method, guides to searching for cells intersected by an isosurface are generated as a pre-process. These guides are two kinds of cell lists: an extrema graph, and sorted lists of boundary cells. In an extrema graph, extremum points are connected by arcs, and each arc has a list of cells through which it passes. At the same time, all boundary cells are sorted according to their minimum and maximum values, and two sorted lists are then generated. Isosurfaces are generated by visiting adjacent intersected cells in order. Here, the starting cells for this process are found by searching in an extrema graph and in sorted boundary cell lists. In this process, isosurfaces appear to propagate themselves. Our algorithm is efficient, since it visits only cells that are intersected by an isosurface and cells whose IDs are included in the guides. It is especially efficient when many isosurfaces are interactively generated in a huge volume. Some benchmark tests described in this paper show the efficiency of the algorithm.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.485619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=485619","","Isosurfaces;Visualization;Displays;Numerical simulation;Temperature;Electronic mail;Costs;Intrusion detection;Benchmark testing;Power engineering computing","data visualisation;computational geometry;graph theory;surface fitting","automatic isosurface propagation;extrema graph;sorted boundary cell lists;high-performance algorithm;isosurface generation;searching;arcs;sorted lists;adjacent intersected cells;benchmark;visualization","","72","1","10","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we demonstrate how features identified by thresholding isosurfaces can be defined in terms of the Morse complex. Second, we present a specialized hierarchy that encodes the feature segmentation independent of the threshold while still providing a flexible multiresolution representation. Third, for a given parameter selection, we create detailed tracking graphs representing the complete evolution of all features in a combustion simulation over several hundred time steps. Finally, we discuss a user interface that correlates the tracking information with interactive rendering of the segmented isosurfaces enabling an in-depth analysis of the temporal behavior. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing three numerical simulations of lean hydrogen flames subject to different levels of turbulence. Due to their unstable nature, lean flames burn in cells separated by locally extinguished regions. The number, area, and evolution over time of these cells provide important insights into the impact of turbulence on the combustion process. Utilizing the hierarchy, we can perform an extensive parameter study without reprocessing the data for each set of parameters. The resulting statistics enable scientists to select appropriate parameters and provide insight into the sensitivity of the results with respect to the choice of parameters. Our method allows for the first time to quantitatively correlate the turbulence of the burning process with the distribution of burning regions, properly segmented and selected. In particular, our analysis shows that counterintuitively stronger turbulence leads to larger cell structures, which burn more intensely than expected. This behavior suggests that flames could be stabilized under much leaner conditions than previously anticipated.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5128904","Visualization;data analysis;topological data analysis;Morse complex;Reeb graph;feature detection;feature tracking;combustion simulations;burning regions.","Hydrogen;Fires;Isosurfaces;Combustion;Robustness;User interfaces;Computer graphics;Information analysis;Numerical simulation;Statistical distributions","combustion;feature extraction;flames;graph theory;graphical user interfaces;image representation;image resolution;image segmentation;interactive systems;numerical analysis;rendering (computer graphics)","burning structures;lean premixed hydrogen flames;topology;isosurfaces;Morse complex;feature segmentation;flexible multiresolution representation;tracking graphs;user interface;interactive rendering;numerical simulations;combustion process","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Fires;Hot Temperature;Hydrogen;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Chemical;Rheology;User-Computer Interface","71","","37","","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To deal with such uncertainties, we first design a local animation, showing the vehicle movements only in the vicinity of cells. Besides, we ignore the micro-behaviors of individual vehicles, and focus on the macro-traffic patterns. We apply existing trajectory aggregation techniques to the dataset, studying cell status pattern and inter-cell flow pattern. Beyond that, we propose to study the correlation between these two patterns with dynamic graph visualization techniques.

Distracting elements like decorative ""chartjunk"" or extraneous information are avoided so as not to slow comprehension. Yet several recent studies in visualization research provide evidence that non-efficient visual elements may benefit comprehension and recall on the part of users. Similarly, findings from studies related to learning from visual displays in various subfields of psychology suggest that introducing cognitive difficulties to visualization interaction can improve a user's understanding of important information. In this paper, we synthesize empirical results from cross-disciplinary research on visual information representations, providing a counterpoint to efficiency-based design theory with guidelines that describe how visual difficulties can be introduced to benefit comprehension and recall. We identify conditions under which the application of visual difficulties is appropriate based on underlying factors in visualization interaction like active processing and engagement. We characterize effective graph design as a trade-off between efficiency and learning difficulties in order to provide Information Visualization (InfoVis) researchers and practitioners with a framework for organizing explorations of graphs for which comprehension and recall are crucial.

While, for regular grids, texture-based techniques are well-suited for current GPUs, the steps necessary for rendering unstructured meshes are not so easily mapped to current hardware. We propose a novel volume rendering technique that simplifies the CPU-based processing and shifts much of the sorting burden to the GPU, where it can be performed more efficiently. Our hardware-assisted visibility sorting algorithm is a hybrid technique that operates in both object-space and image-space. In object-space, the algorithm performs a partial sort of the 3D primitives in preparation for rasterization. The goal of the partial sort is to create a list of primitives that generate fragments in nearly sorted order. In image-space, the fragment stream is incrementally sorted using a fixed-depth sorting network. In our algorithm, the object-space work is performed by the CPU and the fragment-level sorting is done completely on the GPU. A prototype implementation of the algorithm demonstrates that the fragment-level sorting achieves rendering rates of between one and six million tetrahedral cells per second on an ATI Radeon 9800.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407861","Index Terms- Volume visualization;graphics processors;visibility sorting.","Sorting;Rendering (computer graphics);Hardware;Sampling methods;Graphics;Visualization;Image segmentation;Streaming media;Prototypes;Computational fluid dynamics","rendering (computer graphics);data visualisation;image texture;mesh generation;visibility","hardware-assisted visibility sorting algorithm;real-time volume rendering;graphics hardware;unstructured mesh;volume visualization;regular grid;texture-based technique;object-space;image-space;3D primitives;graphics processor","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","69","1","44","","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerical simulation can provide this realism most naturally by modeling the underlying physics of wave propagation. However, wave simulation has traditionally posed a tough computational challenge. In this paper, we present a technique which relies on an adaptive rectangular decomposition of 3D scenes to enable efficient and accurate simulation of sound propagation in complex virtual environments. It exploits the known analytical solution of the wave equation in rectangular domains, and utilizes an efficient implementation of the discrete cosine transform on graphics processors (GPU) to achieve at least a 100-fold performance gain compared to a standard finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) implementation with comparable accuracy, while also being 10-fold more memory efficient. Consequently, we are able to perform accurate numerical acoustic simulation on large, complex scenes in the kilohertz range. To the best of our knowledge, it was not previously possible to perform such simulations on a desktop computer.

In the stress majorization force-directed layout process, separation constraints can be treated as a quadratic programming problem. We give an incremental algorithm based on gradient projection for efficiently solving this problem. The algorithm is considerably faster than using generic constraint optimization techniques and is comparable in speed to unconstrained stress majorization.

This approach allows for interactive streaming and rendering of millions of particles and it enables virtual exploration of high resolution fields in a way similar to real-world experiments. The ability to display the dynamics of large particle sets using visualization options like shaded points or oriented texture splats provides an effective means for visual flow analysis that is far beyond existing solutions.

CGLX allows OpenGL based applications to utilize massively scalable visualization clusters such as multiprojector or high-resolution tiled display environments and to maximize the achievable performance and resolution. The framework features a programming interface for hardware-accelerated rendering of OpenGL applications on visualization clusters, mimicking a GLUT-like (OpenGL-Utility-Toolkit) interface to enable smooth translation of single-node applications to distributed parallel rendering applications. CGLX provides a unified, scalable, distributed OpenGL context to the user by intercepting and manipulating certain OpenGL directives. CGLX's interception mechanism, in combination with the core functionality for users to register callbacks, enables this framework to manage a visualization grid without additional implementation requirements to the user. Although CGLX grants access to its core engine, allowing users to change its default behavior, general development can occur in the context of a standalone desktop. The framework provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) and tools to test, setup, and configure a visualization cluster.

Such applications require both fast rendering and an effortless input regimen for creating and changing architecture using high-level editing operations that automatically fill in the necessary details. Procedural modeling and synthesis is a powerful paradigm that yields high data amplification and can be coupled with fast-rendering techniques to quickly generate plausible details of a scene without much or any user interaction. Previously, forward generating procedural methods have been proposed where a procedure is explicitly created to generate particular content. In this paper, we present our work in inverse procedural modeling of buildings and describe how to use an extracted repertoire of building grammars to facilitate the visualization and quick modification of architectural structures and buildings. We demonstrate an interactive application where the user draws simple building blocks and, using our system, can automatically complete the building ""in the style of other buildings using view-dependent texture mapping or nonphotorealistic rendering techniques. Our system supports an arbitrary number of building grammars created from user subdivided building models and captured photographs. Using only edit, copy, and paste metaphors, the entire building styles can be altered and transferred from one building to another in a few operations, enhancing the ability to modify an existing architectural structure or to visualize a novel building in the style of the others.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.1024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293021","Display algorithms;image-based rendering;modeling packages;visualization systems and software.","Buildings;Power generation;Layout;Rendering (computer graphics);Computer architecture;Computer graphics;Data visualization;Inverse problems;Software algorithms;Software packages","architectural CAD;data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics);structural engineering computing","interactive visualization;nonphotorealistic rendering techniques;inverse procedural modeling;building grammars;architectural structures;view-dependent texture mapping;photographs","Algorithms;Architecture as Topic;Computer Graphics;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;User-Computer Interface;Vocabulary, Controlled","66","7","31","","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While topological data analysis has gained in popularity over the last two decades, it has not yet been widely adopted as a standard data analysis tool for end users or developers. TTK aims at addressing this problem by providing a unified, generic, efficient, and robust implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK/C++) for fast prototyping or through direct, dependency-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems. While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings and extensions.

In this paper, we focus our attention on evaluating the quality of screen content images based on the analysis of structural variation, which is caused by compression, transmission, and more. We classify structures into global and local structures, which correspond to basic and detailed perceptions of humans, respectively. The characteristics of graphic and textual images, e.g., limited color variations, and the human visual system are taken into consideration. Based on these concerns, we systematically combine the measurements of variations in the above-stated two types of structures to yield the final quality estimation of screen content images.

However, they often produce extremely tangled results and exhibit impractical running times for highly non-planar graphs with large edge density. And very few graph layout algorithms support dynamic time-varying graphs; applying them independently to each frame produces distracting temporally incoherent visualizations. We have developed a new visualization technique based on a novel approach to hierarchically structuring dense graphs via stratification. Using this structure, we formulate a hierarchical force-directed layout algorithm that is both efficient and produces quality graph layouts. The stratification of the graph also allows us to present views of the data that abstract away many small details of its structure. Rather than displaying all edges and nodes at once, resulting in a convoluted rendering, we present an interactive tool that filters edges and nodes using the graph hierarchy and allows users to drill down into the graph for details. Our layout algorithm also accommodates time-varying graphs in a natural way, producing a temporally coherent animation that can be used to analyze and extract trends from dynamic graph data. For example, we demonstrate the use of our method to explore financial correlation data for the U.S. stock market in the period from 1990 to 2005. The user can easily analyze the time-varying correlation graph of the market, uncovering information such as market sector trends, representative stocks for portfolio construction, and the interrelationship of stocks over time.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4015433","Graph and network visualization;financial data visualization;hierarchy visualization;time series data","Data visualization;Animation;Data mining;Tree graphs;Layout;Heuristic algorithms;Filters;Algorithm design and analysis;Stock markets;Information analysis","","","","62","","25","","20 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A mesh model may alternatively be provided, in which case a height field is first created via orthogonal or perspective projection. The height field is regularly gridded and treated as an image, enabling a modified AHE method to be used to generate a bas-relief with a user-chosen height range. We modify the original image-contrast-enhancement AHE method to use gradient weights also to enhance the shape features of the bas-relief. To effectively compress the height field, we limit the height-dependent scaling factors used to compute relative height variations in the output from height variations in the input; this prevents any height differences from having too great effect. Results of AHE over different neighborhood sizes are averaged to preserve information at different scales in the resulting bas-relief. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed algorithm is simple and yet largely preserves original shape features. Experiments show that our results are, in general, comparable to and in some cases better than the best previously published methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760139","Bas-relief;adaptive histogram equalization;feature enhancement.","Histograms;Adaptive equalizers;Image coding;Shape;Production;Costs;Sun;Mesh generation;Layout;Automation","computational geometry;image enhancement;mesh generation","bas-relief generation;adaptive histogram equalization;input height field;mesh model;image contrast enhancement AHE method;gradient weights;shape features;height dependent scaling factor","","61","","27","","23 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Evolutionary patterns of ego-networks along time provide huge insights to many domains such as sociology, anthropology, and psychology. However, the analysis of dynamic ego-networks remains challenging due to its complicated time-varying graph structures, for example: alters come and leave, ties grow stronger and fade away, and alter communities merge and split. Most of the existing dynamic graph visualization techniques mainly focus on topological changes of the entire network, which is not adequate for egocentric analytical tasks. In this paper, we present egoSlider, a visual analysis system for exploring and comparing dynamic ego-networks. egoSlider provides a holistic picture of the data through multiple interactively coordinated views, revealing ego-network evolutionary patterns at three different layers: a macroscopic level for summarizing the entire ego-network data, a mesoscopic level for overviewing specific individuals' ego-network evolutions, and a microscopic level for displaying detailed temporal information of egos and their alters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of egoSlider with a usage scenario with the DBLP publication records.

In this paper, we asked users to explicitly manipulate nodes in a network diagram to create layouts that they felt best captured the relationships in the data. This allowed us to measure organizational behavior directly, allowing us to evaluate the perceptual importance of particular visual features, such as edge crossings and edge-lengths uniformity. We also manipulated the interior structure of the node relationships by designing data sets that contained clusters, that is, sets of nodes that are strongly interconnected. By varying the degree to which these clusters were âmaskedâ by extraneous edges we were able to measure observersâ sensitivity to the existence of clusters and how they revealed them in the network diagram. Based on these measurements we found that observers are able to recover cluster structure, that the distance between clusters is inversely related to the strength of the clustering, and that users exhibit the tendency to use edges to visually delineate perceptual groups.

For studying the spatio-temporal patterns and trends of mass mobility, individual OD moves of many people are aggregated into flows (collective moves) by time intervals. Time-variant flow data pose two difficult challenges for visualization and analysis. First, flows may connect arbitrary locations (not only neighbors), thus making a graph with numerous edge intersections, which is hard to visualize in a comprehensible way. Even a single spatial situation consisting of flows in one time step is hard to explore. The second challenge is the need to analyze long time series consisting of numerous spatial situations. We present an approach facilitating exploration of long-term flow data by means of spatial and temporal abstraction. It involves a special way of data aggregation, which allows representing spatial situations by diagram maps instead of flow maps, thus reducing the intersections and occlusions pertaining to flow maps. The aggregated data are used for clustering of time intervals by similarity of the spatial situations. Temporal and spatial displays of the clustering results facilitate the discovery of periodic patterns and longer-term trends in the mass mobility behavior.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2616404","VaVeL(grant numbers:688380); SoBigData(grant numbers:654024); BigData4ATM(grant numbers:699260); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7587808","Movement data;mobility behavior;spatial flow situation;flow map","Time series analysis;Market research;Data visualization;Complexity theory;Electronic mail;Visualization;Clutter","data aggregation;data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;pattern clustering;time series","mass mobility;spatial abstraction;temporal abstraction;origin-destination movement data;OD movement data;spatio-temporal patterns;time-variant flow data;data visualization;data analysis;graph;time series;data aggregation;diagram maps;flow maps;clustering;periodic pattern discovery","","57","","56","IEEE","11 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Creating perceptually effective treemaps requires carefully managing a number of design parameters including the aspect ratio and luminance of rectangles. Moreover, treemaps encode values using area, which has been found to be less accurate than judgments of other visual encodings, such as length. We conduct a series of controlled experiments aimed at producing a set of design guidelines for creating effective rectangular treemaps. We find no evidence that luminance affects area judgments, but observe that aspect ratio does have an effect. Specifically, we find that the accuracy of area comparisons suffers when the compared rectangles have extreme aspect ratios or when both are squares. Contrary to common assumptions, the optimal distribution of rectangle aspect ratios within a treemap should include non-squares, but should avoid extremes. We then compare treemaps with hierarchical bar chart displays to identify the data densities at which length-encoded bar charts become less effective than area-encoded treemaps. We report the transition points at which treemaps exhibit judgment accuracy on par with bar charts for both leaf and non-leaf tree nodes. We also find that even at relatively low data densities treemaps result in faster comparisons than bar charts. Based on these results, we present a set of guidelines for the effective use of treemaps and suggest alternate approaches for treemap layout.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613436","Graphical Perception;Visualization;Treemaps;Rectangular Area;Visual Encoding;Experiment;Mechanical Turk","Encoding;Accuracy;Data visualization;Visualization;Layout;Bars;Guidelines","data visualisation;tree data structures","perceptual guideline;rectangular treemap;space-filling visualization;limited display space;hierarchical data;design parameter;rectangle luminance;visual encoding;design guideline;rectangle aspect ratio;hierarchical bar chart display;data density;length-encoded bar chart;area-encoded treemap;nonleaf tree node;treemap layout","","56","","45","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The acceleration of this class of algorithms is achieved by skipping empty macro regions, which are defined for each background voxel of the volume. Background voxels are labeled in a preprocessing phase by a value, defining the macro region size, which is equal to the voxel distance to the nearest foreground voxel. The CD algorithm exploits the chessboard distance and defines the ray as a nonuniform sequence of samples positioned at voxel faces. This feature assures that no foreground voxels are missed during the scene traversal. Further, due to parallelepipedal shape of the macro region, it supports accelerated visualization of cubic, regular, and rectilinear grids. The CD algorithm is suitable for all modifications of the ray tracing/ray casting techniques being used in volume visualization and volume graphics. However, when used for rendering based on local surface interpolation, it also enables fast search of intersections between rays and the interpolated surface, further improving speed of the process.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.879785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879785","","Ray tracing;Acceleration;Computer graphics;Rendering (computer graphics);Layout;Casting;Data visualization;Data structures;Algorithm design and analysis;Testing","ray tracing;transforms;rendering (computer graphics);data visualisation;interpolation","fast ray tracing;rectilinear volume data;distance transforms;distance based acceleration algorithms;volumetric data;Chessboard Distance voxel traversal;empty macro region skipping;background voxel;preprocessing phase;macro region size;voxel distance;foreground voxel;CD algorithm;nonuniform sequence;voxel faces;scene traversal;parallelepipedal shape;macro region;accelerated visualization;rectilinear grids;ray casting techniques;volume visualization;volume graphics;rendering;local surface interpolation;fast search;interpolated surface","","55","1","29","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional geometry-based methods tend to receive undesirable results due to the complex appearance of human teeth (e.g., missing/rotten teeth, feature-less regions, crowding teeth, extra medical attachments, etc.). Furthermore, labeling of individual tooth is hardly enabled in traditional tooth segmentation methods. To address these issues, we propose to learn a generic and robust segmentation model by exploiting deep Neural Networks, namely NNs. The segmentation task is achieved by labeling each mesh face. We extract a set of geometry features as face feature representations. In the training step, the network is fed with those features, and produces a probability vector, of which each element indicates the probability a face belonging to the corresponding model part. To this end, we extensively experiment with various network structures, and eventually arrive at a 2-level hierarchical CNNs structure for tooth segmentation: one for teeth-gingiva labeling and the other for inter-teeth labeling. Further, we propose a novel boundary-aware tooth simplification method to significantly improve efficiency in the stage of feature extraction. After CNNs prediction, we do graph-based label optimization and further refine the boundary with an improved version of fuzzy clustering. The accuracy of our mesh labeling method exceeds that of the state-of-art geometry-based methods, reaching 99.06 percent measured by area which is directly applicable in orthodontic CAD systems. It is also robust to any possible foreign matters on model surface, e.g., air bubbles, dental accessories, and many more.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2839685","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502306); China Young 1000 Talents Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362667","Boundary-aware simplification;3D mesh segmentation;deep convolutional neural networks;fuzzy clustering","Teeth;Dentistry;Feature extraction;Labeling;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Image segmentation","CAD;convolutional neural nets;dentistry;feature extraction;geometry;graph theory;image representation;image segmentation;medical image processing;optimisation;pattern clustering;probability","deep convolutional neural networks;3D dental model segmentation;human teeth;feature-less regions;generic segmentation model;robust segmentation model;segmentation task;mesh face;geometry features;face feature representations;network structures;2-level hierarchical CNNs structure;teeth-gingiva labeling;inter-teeth labeling;feature extraction;mesh labeling method;geometry-based methods;3D tooth segmentation methods;probability vector;boundary-aware tooth simplification method;graph-based label optimization;fuzzy clustering;orthodontic CAD systems","Algorithms;Dentition;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Neural Networks, Computer;Radiography, Dental;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Tooth","54","","80","IEEE","22 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This can make such vector field analysis unsuitable for rigorous interpretations. We advocate the use of Morse decompositions, which are robust with respect to perturbations, to encode the topological structures of a vector field in the form of a directed graph, called a Morse connection graph (MCG). While an MCG exists for every vector field, it need not be unique. Previous techniques for computing MCGs, while fast, are overly conservative and usually result in MCGs that are too coarse to be useful for the applications. To address this issue, we present a new technique for performing Morse decomposition based on the concept of tau-maps, which typically provides finer MCGs than existing techniques. Furthermore, the choice of tau provides a natural trade-off between the fineness of the MCGs and the computational costs. We provide efficient implementations of Morse decomposition based on tau-maps, which include the use of forward and backward mapping techniques and an adaptive approach in constructing better approximations of the images of the triangles in the meshes used for simulation.

We introduce a procedure called ""loop surgery"" that transforms M into a mesh M' by a sequence of cuts and guarantees the Reeb graph of f(M') to be loop free. Therefore, loop surgery reduces Reeb graph computation to the simpler problem of computing a contour tree, for which well-known algorithms exist that are theoretically efficient (O(n log n)) and fast in practice. Inverse cuts reconstruct the loops removed at the beginning.The time complexity of our algorithm is that of a contour tree computation plus a loop surgery overhead, which depends on the number of handles of the mesh. Our systematic experiments confirm that for real-life data, this overhead is comparable to the computation of the contour tree, demonstrating virtually linear scalability on meshes ranging from 70 thousand to 3.5 million tetrahedra. Performance numbers show that our algorithm, although restricted to volumetric data, has an average speedup factor of 6,500 over the previous fastest techniques, handling larger and more complex data-sets.We demonstrate the verstility of our approach by extending fast topologically clean isosurface extraction to non simply-connected domains. We apply this technique in the context of pressure analysis for mechanical design. In this case, our technique produces results in matter of seconds even for the largest meshes. For the same models, previous Reeb graph techniques do not produce a result.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290727","Reeb graph;scalar field topology;isosurfaces;topological simplification","Surgery;Tree graphs;Data visualization;Isosurfaces;Data mining;Topology;Algorithm design and analysis;Stress;Scalability;Level set","computational complexity;data visualisation;graph theory;mesh generation","loop surgery;volumetric meshes;Reeb graphs;contour trees;scalar function;time complexity;mechanical design pressure analysis","","54","","29","IEEE","23 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multidimensional projections (MDP) figure among the most important visualization techniques in this context, transforming multidimensional data into scatter plots whose visual patterns reflect some notion of similarity in the original data. However, MDP come with distortions that make these visual patterns not trustworthy, hindering users to infer actual data characteristics. Moreover, the patterns present in the scatter plots might not be enough to allow a clear understanding of multidimensional data, motivating the development of layout enrichment methodologies to operate together with MDP. This survey attempts to cover the main aspects of MDP as a visualization and visual analytic tool. It provides detailed analysis and taxonomies as to the organization of MDP techniques according to their main properties and traits, discussing the impact of such properties for visual perception and other human factors. The survey also approaches the different types of distortions that can result from MDP mappings and it overviews existing mechanisms to quantitatively evaluate such distortions. A qualitative analysis of the impact of distortions on the different analytic tasks performed by users when exploring multidimensional data through MDP is also presented. Guidelines for choosing the best MDP for an intended task are also provided as a result of this analysis. Finally, layout enrichment schemes to debunk MDP distortions and/or reveal relevant information not directly inferable from the scatter plot are reviewed and discussed in the light of new taxonomies. We conclude the survey providing future research axes to fill discovered gaps in this domain.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2846735","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico(grant numbers:302643/2013-3); Sao Paulo Research Foundation FAPESP(grant numbers:2016/04391-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8383983","Multidimensional projection;dimensionality reduction;multidimensional scaling;error analysis;layout enrichment","Visualization;Layout;Distortion;Task analysis;Taxonomy;Data visualization;Visual perception","data analysis;data mining;data visualisation","data characteristics;visualization techniques;multidimensional projection;MDP distortions;MDP mappings;visual perception;MDP techniques;visual analytic tool;layout enrichment methodologies;visual patterns;scatter plot;multidimensional projections figure;data dimensionality;multidimensional data;visual analytics","","54","","182","IEEE","13 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multiscale pan-and-zoom systems are effective because they directly support this approach. However, generating abstract overviews of large data sets is difficult and most systems take advantage of only one type of abstraction: visual abstraction. Furthermore, these existing systems limit the analyst to a single zooming path on their data and thus to a single set of abstract views. This paper presents: 1) a formalism for describing multiscale visualizations of data cubes with both data and visual abstraction and 2) a method for independently zooming along one or more dimensions by traversing a zoom graph with nodes at different levels of detail. As an example of how to design multiscale visualizations using our system, we describe four design patterns using our formalism.

The registration of these two scans is desirable so that the user can clarify situations or confirm polyp findings at a location in one scan with the same location in the other, thereby improving polyp detection rates and reducing false positives. However, this supine-prone registration is challenging because of the substantial distortions in the colon shape due to the patient's change in position. We present an efficient algorithm and framework for performing this registration through the use of conformal geometry to guarantee that the registration is a diffeomorphism (a one-to-one and onto mapping). The taeniae coli and colon flexures are automatically extracted for each supine and prone surface, employing the colon geometry. The two colon surfaces are then divided into several segments using the flexures, and each segment is cut along a taenia coli and conformally flattened to the rectangular domain using holomorphic differentials. The mean curvature is color encoded as texture images, from which feature points are automatically detected using graph cut segmentation, mathematic morphological operations, and principal component analysis. Corresponding feature points are found between supine and prone and are used to adjust the conformal flattening to be quasi-conformal, such that the features become aligned. We present multiple methods of visualizing our results, including 2D flattened rendering, corresponding 3D endoluminal views, and rendering of distortion measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our registration method by illustrating matched views on both the 2D flattened colon images and in the 3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the correctness of the results by measuring the distance between features on the registered colons.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613475","Data registration;geometry-based techniques;medical visualization;mathematical foundations for visualization.","Colon;Conformal mapping;Feature extraction;Surface morphology;Visualization;Three dimensional displays;Harmonic analysis","computerised tomography;conformal mapping;graph theory;image registration;image segmentation;image texture;medical image processing;principal component analysis;rendering (computer graphics)","supine colon registration;prone colon registration;quasiconformal mapping;virtual colonoscopy;CT scans;polyp findings;polyp detection rates;supine-prone registration;substantial distortions;colon shape;conformal geometry;diffeomorphism;taeniae coli;colon flexures;colon geometry;colon surfaces;rectangular domain;holomorphic differentials;mean curvature;texture images;graph cut segmentation;mathematic morphological operations;principal component analysis;conformal flattening;2D flattened rendering;3D endoluminal views;distortion measurements;registration method;2D flattened colon images;3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view","Algorithms;Colon;Colonography, Computed Tomographic;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Anatomic;Prone Position;Supine Position","54","1","39","IEEE","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, we present the FlowVizMenu, a radial menu containing a scatterplot that can be popped up transiently and manipulated with rapid, fluid gestures to select and modify the axes of its scatterplot. Second, the FlowVizMenu can be used to steer an attribute-driven layout of the network, causing certain nodes of a node-link diagram to move toward their corresponding positions in a scatterplot while others can be positioned manually or by force-directed layout. Third, we describe a novel hybrid approach that combines a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) and parallel coordinates called the Parallel Scatterplot Matrix (P-SPLOM), which can be used to visualize and select features within the network.

In this paper we describe Vectorized Radviz (VRV) which extends the number of dimensions through data flattening. We show how VRV increases the power of Radviz through these extra dimensions by enhancing the flexibility in the layout of the DAs. We apply VRV to the problem of analyzing the results of multiple clusterings of the same data set, called multiple cluster sets or cluster ensembles. We show how features of VRV help discern patterns across the multiple cluster sets.

These 'small multiples' are ordered by the conditioning variable values and are laid out hierarchically using dimensional stacking. Crucially, we consider the use of different layouts at different hierarchical levels, so that the coordinates of the plane can be used more effectively to draw attention to trends and anomalies in the data. We argue that these layouts should be informed by the type of conditioning variable and by the research question being explored. We focus on space-filling rectangular layouts that provide data-dense and rich overviews of data to address research questions posed in our exploratory analysis of spatial and temporal aspects of property sales in London.

We present two taxonomies of visualizations of dynamic graphs: one of non-hybrid techniques, and one of hybrid techniques. We also describe a prototype, called DiffAni, that allows a graph to be visualized as a sequence of three kinds of tiles: diff tiles that show difference maps over some time interval, animation tiles that show the evolution of the graph over some time interval, and small multiple tiles that show the graph state at an individual time slice. This sequence of tiles is ordered by time and covers all time slices in the data.

Projection techniques generally aim to make a high-dimensional information space visible in form of a planar layout. However, the meaning of the resulting data projections can be hard to grasp. It is seldom clear why elements are placed far apart or close together and the inevitable approximation errors of any projection technique are not exposed to the viewer. Previous research on dimensionality reduction focuses on the efficient generation of data projections, interactive customisation of the model, and comparison of different projection techniques. There has been only little research on how the visualization resulting from data projection is interacted with. We contribute the concept of probing as an integrated approach to interpreting the meaning and quality of visualizations and propose a set of interactive methods to examine dimensionality-reduced data as well as the projection itself. The methods let viewers see approximation errors, question the positioning of elements, compare them to each other, and visualize the influence of data dimensions on the projection space.

We have derived an analytical solution that extracts the sensitivity as the derivative of centrality with respect to degree for two centrality metrics based on feedback and random walks. We show that these sensitivities are good indicators of the distribution of centrality in the network, and how changes are expected to be propagated if we introduce changes to the network. These metrics also help us simplify a complex network in a way that retains the main structural properties and that results in trustworthy, readable diagrams. Sensitivity is also a key concept for uncertainty analysis of social networks, and we show how our approach may help analysts gain insight on the robustness of key network metrics.

Sophisticated visualization tools help to gain insight. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the interactive comparison of scalar fields using isosurfaces, and its application to fluid flow datasets. Features in two scalar fields are defined by largest contour segmentation after topological simplification. These features are matched using a volumetric similarity measure based on spatial overlap of individual features. The relationships defined by this similarity measure are ranked and presented in a thumbnail gallery of feature pairs and a graph representation showing all relationships between individual contours. Additionally, linked views of the contour trees are provided to ease navigation. The main render view shows the selected features overlapping each other. Thus, by displaying individual features and their relationships in a structured fashion, we enable exploratory visualization of correlations between similar structures in two scalar fields. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a number of complex fluid flow datasets, where the emphasis is put on the comparison of vortex related scalar quantities.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658165","Index Termsâ;Scalar topology;comparative visualization;contour tree;largest contours;flow visualization","Data visualization;Isosurfaces;Fluid flow;Tree graphs;Data mining;Computer vision;Volume measurement;Navigation;Topology;Shape","computer graphics;edge detection;flow visualisation","scalar fields;flow visualization;contour segmentation;topological simplification;volumetric similarity measure;contour trees;complex fluid flow datasets","","49","","36","","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We conducted a Wizard of Oz study to explore applying pen and touch interaction to the creation of information visualization interfaces on interactive whiteboards without implementing a plethora of recognizers. Our wizard acted as a robust and flexible pen and touch recognizer, giving participants maximum freedom in how they interacted with the system.

We present a technique that extends the Massive Sequence View ( msv) for the analysis of temporal and structural aspects of dynamic networks. Using features in the data as well as Gestalt principles in the visualization such as closure, proximity, and similarity, we developed node reordering strategies for the msv to make these features stand out that optionally take the hierarchical node structure into account. This enables users to find temporal properties such as trends, counter trends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in the network as well as structural properties such as communities and stars. We introduce the circular msv that further reduces visual clutter. In addition, the (circular) msv is extended to also convey time-series data associated with the nodes. This enables users to analyze complex correlations between edge occurrence and node attribute changes.

In our framework, we compute the total entropy of the multivariate data set and identify the contribution of individual variables to the total entropy. The variables are classified into groups based on a novel graph model where a node represents a variable and the links encode the mutual information shared between the variables. The variables inside the groups are analyzed for their representativeness and an information based importance is assigned. We exploit specific information metrics to analyze the relationship between the variables and use the metrics to choose isocontours of selected variables. For a chosen group of points, parallel coordinates plots (PCP) are used to show the states of the variables and provide an interface for the user to select values of interest.

We propose Temporal Multidimensional Scaling (TMDS), a novel visualization technique that computes temporal one-dimensional MDS plots for multivariate data which evolve over time. Using a sliding window approach, MDS is computed for each data window separately, and the results are plotted sequentially along the time axis, taking care of plot alignment. Our TMDS plots enable visual identification of patterns based on multidimensional similarity of the data evolving over time.

Two experiments with novices and one experiment with experts were performed. The results with novices showed that the pseudo-chromadepth and fog cues were stronger cues than that of stereopsis. Furthermore, the addition of the stereopsis cue to the other cues did not improve relative depth perception in cerebral vascular volumes. In contrast to novices, the experts also performed well with the edge cue. In terms of both novice and expert subjects, pseudo-chromadepth and fog allow for the best relative depth perception.

It allows for the articulation of compound marks or glyphs as well as links between these glyphs, all without requiring any coding or knowledge of constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, thanks to the constraint-based layout approach, Charticulator can export chart designs into reusable templates that can be imported into other visualization tools.

We find, in common with many other studies, that removing edge crossings is the most significant aesthetic, but also discover that aligning nodes and edges to an underlying grid is important. We observe that the aesthetics favored by participants during creation of a graph drawing are often not evident in the final product and that the participants did not make a clear distinction between the processes of creation and layout.

It adheres to the visual information-seeking mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand. MGV's only assumption is that the vertex set of the underlying digraph corresponds to the set of leaves of a pre-determined tree T. MGV builds an out-of-core graph hierarchy and provides mechanisms to plug in arbitrary visual representations for each graph hierarchy slice. Navigation from one level to another of the hierarchy corresponds to the implementation of a drill-down interface. In order to provide the user with navigation control and interactive response, MGV incorporates a number of visualization techniques like interactive pixel-oriented 2D and 3D maps, statistical displays, color maps, multi-linked views and a zoomable label-based interface. This makes the association of geographic information and graph data very natural. To automate the creation of the vertex set hierarchy for MGV, we use the notion of graph sketches. They can be thought of as visual indices that guide the navigation of a multigraph too large to fit on the available display. MGV follows the client-server paradigm and it is implemented in C and Java-3D. We highlight the main algorithmic and visualization techniques behind the tools and, along the way, point out several possible application scenarios.

The lens keeps the selected data in focus unchanged and continuously deforms the data out of the selection range in order to maintain the context around the focus. Specific deformations include distance-based repulsion of scatter plot points, deforming straight-line node-link graph drawings, and as varying the simplification degree of bundled edge graph layouts. Using a brushing-based technique, we further show the applicability of our semantic lens for scenarios requiring a complex selection of the zones of interest.

Our technique utilizes stereoscopic depth to highlight regions of interest in a 2D graph by projecting these parts onto a plane closer to the viewpoint of the user. This technique aims to isolate and magnify specific portions of the graph that need to be explored in detail without resorting to other highlighting techniques like color or motion, which can then be reserved to encode other data attributes. This mechanism of stereoscopic highlighting also enables focus+context views by juxtaposing a detailed image of a region of interest with the overall graph, which is visualized at a further depth with correspondingly less detail. In order to validate our technique, we ran a controlled experiment with 16 subjects comparing static visual highlighting to stereoscopic highlighting on 2D and 3D graph layouts for a range of tasks. Our results show that while for most tasks the difference in performance between stereoscopic highlighting alone and static visual highlighting is not statistically significant, users performed better when both highlighting methods were used concurrently. In more complicated tasks, 3D layout with static visual highlighting outperformed 2D layouts with a single highlighting method. However, it did not outperform the 2D layout utilizing both highlighting techniques simultaneously. Based on these results, we conclude that stereoscopic highlighting is a promising technique that can significantly enhance graph visualizations for certain use cases.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064999","Graph visualization;stereo displays;virtual reality.","Two dimensional displays;Graphics;Stereo image processing;Data visualization;Image color analysis","data visualisation;graph theory;three-dimensional displays","stereoscopic highlighting;2D graph visualization;stereo displays;data attributes;focus+context views;static visual highlighting;3D layout;2D layout","","46","","30","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, social scientists may want to investigate asymmetric relations in organizations with strict chains of command, or incorporate non-actors such as conferences and projects when analyzing coauthorship patterns. Multimodal social networks are those where actors and relations belong to different types, or modes, and multimodal social network analysis (mSNA) is accordingly SNA for such networks. In this paper, we present a design study that we conducted with several social scientist collaborators on how to support mSNA using visual analytics tools. Based on an openended, formative design process, we devised a visual representation called parallel node-link bands (PNLBs) that splits modes into separate bands and renders connections between adjacent ones, similar to the list view in Jigsaw. We then used the tool in a qualitative evaluation involving five social scientists whose feedback informed a second design phase that incorporated additional network metrics. Finally, we conducted a second qualitative evaluation with our social scientist collaborators that provided further insights on the utility of the PNLBs representation and the potential of visual analytics for mSNA.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634091","Social network services;Visual analytics;Data visualization;Complexity theory;Design methodology;User centered design;qualitative evaluation;Design study;user-centered design;node-link diagrams;multimodal graphs;interaction","Social network services;Visual analytics;Data visualization;Complexity theory;Design methodology;User centered design","data visualisation;network theory (graphs);pattern recognition;social networking (online);social sciences computing","multimodal social network analysis;social science;organization asymmetric relations;coauthorship pattern analysis;mSNA;visual analytics tools;formative design process;visual representation;parallel node-link bands;PNLB;network metrics","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Theoretical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Social Media;Social Sciences;User-Computer Interface","46","","55","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we introduce an interactive visual data mining approach based on an adaptation of techniques developed for Web searching, combined with an intuitive visual interface, to facilitate user-centred exploration of the data and identification of sequences significant to that user. The search algorithm used in the exploration executes in negligible time, even for large data, and so no pre-processing of the selected data is required, making this a completely interactive experience for the user.

Our new algorithm builds on PLP and provides an efficient way of finding the remaining visible primitives. We do this by adding a second phase to PLP which uses image-space techniques for determining the visibility status of the remaining geometry. Another contribution of our work is to show how to efficiently implement such image-space visibility queries using currently available OpenGL hardware and extensions.

Only recently have other forms of interaction begun to appear, such as natural language or touch-based interaction, though usually operating only independently. Prior evaluations of natural language interfaces for visualization have indicated potential value in combining direct manipulation and natural language as complementary interaction techniques. We hypothesize that truly multimodal interfaces for visualization, those providing users with freedom of expression via both natural language and touch-based direct manipulation input, may provide an effective and engaging user experience. Unfortunately, however, little work has been done in exploring such multimodal visualization interfaces. To address this gap, we have created an architecture and a prototype visualization system called Orko that facilitates both natural language and direct manipulation input. Specifically, Orko focuses on the domain of network visualization, one that has largely relied on WIMP-based interfaces and direct manipulation interaction, and has little or no prior research exploring natural language interaction. We report results from an initial evaluation study of Orko, and use our observations to discuss opportunities and challenges for future work in multimodal network visualization interfaces.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745219","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8019860","Multimodal interaction;network visualization;natural language input;direct manipulation;multitouch input","Data visualization;Natural languages;Visualization;Taxonomy;Prototypes;Mice;Speech","data visualisation;interactive systems;natural language interfaces","Orko;multimodal interaction;visual exploration;data visualization systems;direct manipulation interfaces;natural language interfaces;complementary interaction techniques;direct manipulation input;prototype visualization system;multimodal network visualization interfaces;touch-based direct manipulation input;WIMP-based interfaces","","45","","70","IEEE","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each textual snippet shows a content summary of the referred document (or webpage) and a link to it. This display has many advantages, for example, it affords easy navigation and is straightforward to interpret. Nonetheless, any user of search engines could possibly report some experience of disappointment with this metaphor. Indeed, it has limitations in particular situations, as it fails to provide an overview of the document collection retrieved. Moreover, depending on the nature of the query for example, it may be too general, or ambiguous, or ill expressed the desired information may be poorly ranked, or results may contemplate varied topics. Several search tasks would be easier if users were shown an overview of the returned documents, organized so as to reflect how related they are, content wise. We propose a visualization technique to display the results of web queries aimed at overcoming such limitations. It combines the neighborhood preservation capability of multidimensional projections with the familiar snippet-based representation by employing a multidimensional projection to derive two-dimensional layouts of the query search results that preserve text similarity relations, or neighborhoods. Similarity is computed by applying the cosine similarity over a ""bag-of-wordsÃ¢' vector representation of collection built from the snippets. If the snippets are displayed directly according to the derived layout, they will overlap considerably, producing a poor visualization. We overcome this problem by defining an energy functional that considers both the overlapping among snippets and the preservation of the neighborhood structure as given in the projected layout. Minimizing this energy functional provides a neighborhood preserving two-dimensional arrangement of the textual snippets with minimum overlap. The resulting visualization conveys both a global view of the query results and visual groupings that reflect related results, as illustrated in several examples shown.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6629989","Multidimensional projection;web search visualization","Visualization;Layout;Search engines;Vectors;Optimization;Web pages;Navigation","data visualisation;document handling;Internet;query processing;search engines","similarity preserving snippet based visualization;Web search results;Internet;search query;textual snippet;referred document;Web page;search engines;document collection retrieval;Web queries;query search;text similarity;energy functional","","45","1","35","","11 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conversion method also allows a user to interactively control viewing parameters of the displayed image for reproducing the dynamic 3D scene with desirable parameters.

Dealing with these lengths is a challenge, especially for large graphs. Stress models are often employed in this situation. However, the traditional full stress model is not scalable due to its reliance on an initial all-pairs shortest path calculation. A number of fast approximation algorithms have been proposed. While they work well for some graphs, the results are less satisfactory on graphs of intrinsically high dimension, because some nodes may be placed too close together, or even share the same position. We propose a solution, called the maxent-stress model, which applies the principle of maximum entropy to cope with the extra degrees of freedom. We describe a force-augmented stress majorization algorithm that solves the maxent-stress model. Numerical results show that the algorithm scales well, and provides acceptable layouts for large, nonrigid graphs.

In this paper we show that, although RadViz can be useful when analyzing sparse data, in general this design choice limits its applicability and introduces several drawbacks for exploratory data analysis. In particular, we observe that the normalization step introduces nonlinear distortions, can encumber outlier detection, prevents associating the plots with useful linear mappings, and impedes estimating original data attributes accurately. In addition, users have greater flexibility when choosing different layouts and views of the data in star coordinates. Therefore, we suggest that analysts and researchers should carefully consider whether RadViz's normalization step is beneficial regarding the data sets' characteristics and analysis tasks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467324","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n(grant numbers:TIN2011-29542-C02-01); Human Brain Project; Cajal Blue Brain Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192699","RadViz;Star coordinates;Exploratory data analysis;Cluster analysis;Classication;Outlier detection;RadViz;Star coordinates;Exploratory data analysis;Cluster analysis;Classification;Outlier detection","Distributed databases;Data visualization;Layout;Springs;Shape;Data analysis;Nonlinear distortion","data analysis;data visualisation","RadViz coordinate;Star coordinate;projection-based multivariate visualization techniques;radial layouts;nonlinear normalization step;sparse data analysis;exploratory data analysis;nonlinear distortions;outlier detection;linear mappings","","42","","45","IEEE","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Exemplar-based visualization (EV), to visualize an extremely large text corpus. Capitalizing on recent advances in matrix approximation and decomposition, EV presents a probabilistic multidimensional projection model in the low-rank text subspace with a sound objective function. The probability of each document proportion to the topics is obtained through iterative optimization and embedded to a low dimensional space using parameter embedding. By selecting the representative exemplars, we obtain a compact approximation of the data. This makes the visualization highly efficient and flexible. In addition, the selected exemplars neatly summarize the entire data set and greatly reduce the cognitive overload in the visualization, leading to an easier interpretation of large text corpus.

We then give a practical framework for adjusting singularity graphs by automatically modifying the rotational transition of frames between charts (cells of a tetrahedral mesh for the volume) to resolve the issues detected in the internal and boundary singularity graph. After applying an additional re-smoothing of the frame field with the modified transition conditions, we cut the volume into a topologically trivial domain, with the original topology encoded by the self-intersections of the boundary of the domain, and solve a mixed integer problem on this domain for a global parameterization.

Our goal is to provide interactive tools to perform common illumination, i.e., light interactions between real and virtual objects, including shadows and relighting (real and virtual light source modification). In particular, we concentrate on virtually modifying real light source intensities and inserting virtual lights and objects into a real scene; such changes can be very useful for virtual lighting design and prototyping. To achieve this, we present a three-step method. We first reconstruct a simplified representation of real scene geometry using semiautomatic vision-based techniques. With the simplified geometry, and by adapting recent hierarchical radiosity algorithms, we construct an approximation of real scene light exchanges. We next perform a preprocessing step, based on the radiosity system, to create unoccluded illumination textures. These replace the original scene textures which contained real light effects such as shadows from real lights. This texture is then modulated by a ratio of the radiosity (which can be changed) over a display factor which corresponds to the radiosity for which occlusion has been ignored. Since our goal is to achieve a convincing relighting effect, rather than an accurate solution, we present a heuristic correction process which results in visually plausible renderings. Finally, we perform an interactive process to compute new illumination with modified real and virtual light intensities.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.895874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895874","","Layout;Lighting;Augmented reality;Light sources;Image reconstruction;Geometry;Solid modeling;Casting;Virtual prototyping;Approximation algorithms","augmented reality;image processing;interactive systems;lighting;brightness;rendering (computer graphics)","interactive virtual relighting;real scenes;augmented reality;heuristic correction process;shadows;virtual lighting design;real scene geometry;semiautomatic vision;radiosity;unoccluded illumination texture;rendering","","42","28","33","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, existing visualization design guidelines typically focus on single rather than multiple views. Solely following these guidelines can lead to effective yet inconsistent views (e.g., the same field has different axes domains across charts), making interpretation slow and error-prone. Moreover, little is known how consistency balances with other design considerations, making it difficult to incorporate consistency mechanisms in visualization authoring software. We present a wizard-of-oz study in which we observed how Tableau users achieve and sacrifice consistency in an exploration-to-presentation visualization design scenario. We extend (from our prior work) a set of encoding-specific constraints defining consistency across multiple views. Using the constraints as a checklist in our study, we observed cases where participants spontaneously maintained consistent encodings and warned cases where consistency was overlooked. In response to the warnings, participants either revised views for consistency or stated why they thought consistency should be overwritten. We categorize participants' actions and responses as constraint validations and exceptions, depicting the relative importance of consistency and other design considerations under various circumstances (e.g., data cardinality, available encoding resources, chart layout). We discuss automatic consistency checking as a constraint-satisfaction problem and provide design implications for communicating inconsistencies to users.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8017651","Visualization Design;Qualitative Study;Evaluation","Encoding;Data visualization;Image color analysis;Visualization;Adaptation models;Color;Guidelines","constraint satisfaction problems;constraint theory;data visualisation","dashboard;visualization design guidelines;visualization authoring software;exploration-to-presentation visualization design scenario;consistent encodings;constraint validations;automatic consistency checking;consistency mechanisms;encoding-specific constraints;constraint-satisfaction;Tableau users","","42","","34","IEEE","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To save time and reduce memory load, users are only involved in the first step - initialization of sampling - and the last step - visual analysis of output. This helps users to more thoroughly explore the parameter space and produce higher quality results. We describe a custom sampling plug-in we developed for CellProfiler - a popular biomedical image analysis framework. Our main focus is the development of an interactive visualization technique that enables users to analyze the relationships between sampled input parameters and corresponding output. We implemented this in a prototype called Paramorama. It provides users with a visual overview of parameters and their sampled values. User-defined areas of interest are presented in a structured way that includes image-based output and a novel layout algorithm.

Despite the superhuman performance, in-depth understanding of the model and interpreting the sophisticated behaviors of the DQN agent remain to be challenging tasks, due to the long-time model training process and the large number of experiences dynamically generated by the agent. In this work, we propose DQNViz, a visual analytics system to expose details of the blind training process in four levels, and enable users to dive into the large experience space of the agent for comprehensive analysis. As an initial attempt in visualizing DQN models, our work focuses more on Atari games with a simple action space, most notably the Breakout game. From our visual analytics of the agent's experiences, we extract useful action/reward patterns that help to interpret the model and control the training.

With large scale data on mobility patterns, operators can move away from the costly, mostly survey based, transportation planning processes, to a more data-centric view, that places the instrumented user at the center of development. In this framework, using mobile phone data to perform transit analysis and optimization represents a new frontier with significant societal impact, especially in developing countries. In this paper we present AllAboard, an intelligent tool that analyses cellphone data to help city authorities in visually exploring urban mobility and optimizing public transport. This is performed within a self contained tool, as opposed to the current solutions which rely on a combination of several distinct tools for analysis, reporting, optimisation and planning.

One use of supercomputers is to generate field lines from large scale flow fields. When generating field lines in parallel, the vector field is generally decomposed into blocks, which are then assigned to processors. Since various regions of the vector field can have different flow complexity, processors will require varying amounts of computation time to trace their particles, causing load imbalance, and thus limiting the performance speedup. To achieve load-balanced streamline generation, we propose a workload-aware partitioning algorithm to decompose the vector field into partitions with near equal workloads. Since actual workloads are unknown beforehand, we propose a workload estimation algorithm to predict the workload in the local vector field. A graph-based representation of the vector field is employed to generate these estimates. Once the workloads have been estimated, our partitioning algorithm is hierarchically applied to distribute the workload to all partitions. We examine the performance of our workload estimation and workload-aware partitioning algorithm in several timings studies, which demonstrates that by employing these methods, better scalability can be achieved with little overhead.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064941","Flow visualization;Parallel processing;3D vector field visualization;Streamlines.","Partitioning algorithms;Cost function;Mathematical model","data visualisation;graph theory;parallel processing;resource allocation","load balanced parallel streamline generation;large scale vector fields;flow complexity;load imbalance;workload aware partitioning algorithm;workload estimation algorithm;graph based representation","","40","","24","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to visualize this large and complex data, we employ two linked views of the hardware network. The first is a 2D view, that represents the network structure as one of several simplified planar projections. This view is designed to allow a user to easily identify trends and patterns in the network traffic. The second is a 3D view that augments the 2D view by preserving the physical network topology and providing a context that is familiar to the application developers.

This paper is strongly inspired by the observation in human vision and perception that a sudden change in the luminance plays a critical role to faithfully represent and recover the 3D information. In particular, we adopt the edge detection techniques in image processing for 3D shape visualization and present Photic Extremum Lines (PELs) which emphasize significant variations of illumination over 3D surfaces. Comparing with the existing feature lines, PELs are more flexible and offer users more freedom to achieve desirable visualization effects. In addition, the user can easily control the shape visualization by changing the light position, the number of light sources, and choosing various light models. We compare PELs with the existing approaches and demonstrate that PEL is a flexible and effective tool to illustrate 3D surface and volume for visual computing.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376158","Surface and volume illustration;illumination;photic extremum lines (PELs);silhouettes;suggestive contours;ridges and valleys;digital geometry processing.","Humans;Image edge detection;Lighting;Data visualization;Layout;Geometry;Image processing;Shape control;Solid modeling","computational geometry;data visualisation;edge detection","3D shape visualization;image processing;edge detection;feature lines;photic extremum lines;illustrative visualization framework","Algorithms;Anatomy, Artistic;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Lighting;Medical Illustration;Models, Anatomic;User-Computer Interface","39","","38","IEEE","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The user explores the network by changing the focal node in the detailed view or by changing the level of detail of a node or cluster. For scalability, fast force-based layout algorithms are used for the overview and the detailed view. However, using the same layout algorithm in both views is problematic since layout for the detailed view has different requirements to that in the overview. Here we present a model in which constrained graph layout algorithms are used for layout in the detailed view. This means the detailed view has high-quality layout including sophisticated edge routing and is customisable by the user who can add placement constraints on the layout. Scalability is still ensured since the slower layout techniques are only applied to the small subgraph shown in the detailed view. The main technical innovations are techniques to ensure that the overview and detailed view remain synchronized, and modifying constrained graph layout algorithms to support smooth, stable layout. The key innovation supporting stability are new dynamic graph layout algorithms that preserve the topology or structure of the network when the user changes the focus node or the level of detail by in situ semantic zooming.

Specifically, we show that BubbleSets is the best alternative for tasks involving group membership assessment; that visually encoding group information over basic node-link diagrams incurs an accuracy penalty of about 25 percent in solving network tasks; and that GMap's use of prominent group labels improves memorability. We also show that GMap's visual metaphor can be slightly altered to outperform BubbleSets in group membership assessment.

As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065000","Dynamic graph data;multiform visualization;multi-focus+context.","Data visualization;Graphics","data visualisation;graph theory;network theory (graphs)","large dynamic networks;in situ exploration;bot nets;social networks;visualization techniques;network structure;visual analysis;visual representations;mental map;dynamic graph visualization;model versioning;wireless mesh networks","","39","1","51","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The literature provides a large body of existing solutions that help users accomplish comparison tasks. These solutions are mostly of visual nature and custom-made for specific data. We ask the question if a more general support is possible by focusing on the interaction aspect of comparison tasks. As an answer to this question, we propose a novel interaction concept that is inspired by real-world behavior of people comparing information printed on paper. In line with real-world interaction, our approach supports users (1) in interactively specifying pieces of graphical information to be compared, (2) in flexibly arranging these pieces on the screen, and (3) in performing the actual comparison of side-by-side and overlapping arrangements of the graphical information. Complementary visual cues and add-ons further assist users in carrying out comparison tasks. Our concept and the integrated interaction techniques are generally applicable and can be coupled with different visualization techniques. We implemented an interactive prototype and conducted a qualitative user study to assess the concept's usefulness in the context of three different visualization techniques. The obtained feedback indicates that our interaction techniques mimic the natural behavior quite well, can be learned quickly, and are easy to apply to visual comparison tasks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327278","Interaction techniques;visual comparison;visualization;human-computer interaction;natural interaction","Visualization;Data visualization;Shape;Layout;Animation;Navigation;Computers","data analysis;data visualisation","interaction support;visual comparison;natural behavior;interactive data exploration;interactive data analysis;interaction concept;complementary visual cues;integrated interaction technique;visualization technique","","39","","51","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By addressing this problem, we introduce a semi-automatic method for initial generation of TFs. The proposed method uses a Self Generating Hierarchical Radial Basis Function Network to determine the lobes of a Volume Histogram Stack (VHS) which is introduced as a new domain by aligning the histograms of slices of a image series. The new self generating hierarchical design strategy allows the recognition of suppressed lobes corresponding to suppressed tissues and representation of the overlapping regions which are parts of the lobes but can not be represented by the Gaussian bases in VHS. Moreover, approximation with a minimum set of basis functions provides the possibility of selecting and adjusting suitable units to optimize the TF.

We present Summit, an interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes. Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a prevalent, large-scale image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design.

While there are several automatic techniques, little has been done to evaluate their effectiveness empirically. In this paper we present two experiments studying the impact of edge curvature on graph readability. The goal is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of using curved edges for common graph tasks compared to straight line segments, which are the conventional choice for showing edges in node-link diagrams. We included several edge variations: straight edges, edges with different curvature levels, and mixed straight and curved edges.

Several preliminary studies have demonstrated the benefits and effectiveness of this modality. Unfortunately, previous work cannot guarantee that an existing anomaly will be detected, especially for complex organs with multiple branches. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reliable navigation, which ensures the interior organ surface is fully examined by the physician performing the virtual endoscopy procedure. To achieve this, we propose computing a reliable fly-through path that ensures no blind areas during the navigation. Theoretically, we discuss the criteria of evaluating a reliable path and prove that the problem of generating an optimal reliable path for virtual endoscopy is NP-complete. In practice, we develop an efficient method for the calculation of an effective reliable path. First, a small set of center observation points are automatically located inside the hollow organ. For each observation point, there exists at least one patch of interior surface visible to it, but that cannot be seen from any of the other observation points. These chosen points are then linked with a path that stays in the center of the organ. Finally, new points inside the organ are recursively selected and connected into the path until the entire organ surface is visible from the path. We present encouraging results from experiments on several data sets. For a medium-size volumetric model with several hundred thousand inner voxels, an effective reliable path can be generated in several minutes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.965347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=965347","","Endoscopes;Humans;Navigation;Cameras;Reliability theory;Automatic control;Switches;Helium;Biomedical imaging;Computer graphics","path planning;computational complexity;optimisation;medical image processing;visibility;reliability;computerised navigation;data visualisation","virtual endoscopy;computerized noninvasive procedure;human organs examination;anomaly detection;organ branches;reliable navigation;interior organ surface;optimal reliable fly-through path;blind areas;NP-complete problem;center observation points;hollow organ;visibility;recursively selected points;volumetric model;inner voxels;camera control","","38","2","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental results showed that a BCI and an OST-HMD equipment (EEG headset and Hololens in our case) are well compatible and that small movements of the head can be tolerated when using the BCI. Second, we introduced a design space for command display strategies based on BCI in AR, when exploiting a famous brain pattern called Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Our design space relies on five dimensions concerning the visual layout of the BCI menu; namely: orientation, frame-of-reference, anchorage, size and explicitness. We implemented various BCI-based display strategies and tested them within the context of mobile robot control in AR. Our findings were finally integrated within an operational prototype based on a real mobile robot that is controlled in AR using a BCI and a HoloLens headset.

We propose the notion of zoomable treemaps (ZTMs), an hybridization between treemaps and zoomable user interfaces that facilitates the navigation in large hierarchical data sets. By providing a consistent set of interaction techniques, ZTMs make it possible for users to browse through very large data sets (e.g., 700,000 nodes dispatched amongst 13 levels).

"Graphical Overlays: Using Layered Elements to Aid Chart Reading","N. Kong; M.

Yet, most of the charts that are published in newspapers, reports, books, and on the Web only support a subset of these tasks. In this paper we introduce graphical overlays-visual elements that are layered onto charts to facilitate a larger set of chart reading tasks. These overlays directly support the lower-level perceptual and cognitive processes that viewers must perform to read a chart. We identify five main types of overlays that support these processes; the overlays can provide (1) reference structures such as gridlines, (2) highlights such as outlines around important marks, (3) redundant encodings such as numerical data labels, (4) summary statistics such as the mean or max and (5) annotations such as descriptive text for context. We then present an automated system that applies user-chosen graphical overlays to existing chart bitmaps. Our approach is based on the insight that generating most of these graphical overlays only requires knowing the properties of the visual marks and axes that encode the data, but does not require access to the underlying data values. Thus, our system analyzes the chart bitmap to extract only the properties necessary to generate the desired overlay. We also discuss techniques for generating interactive overlays that provide additional controls to viewers. We demonstrate several examples of each overlay type for bar, pie and line charts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327269","Visualization;overlays;graphical perception;graph comprehension","Visualization;Encoding;Image color analysis;Data mining;Data visualization;Bars;Market research","charts;data visualisation","layered elements;aid chart reading;visualization;aggregating numerical values;World Wide Web;visual elements;chart reading task;cognitive processes;redundant encoding;numerical data label;summary statistics;descriptive text;automated system;user chosen graphical overlays;chart bitmaps;visual marks;interactive overlays;bar charts;pie charts;line charts","","37","10","38","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We extend an existing ranking technique to compute a multifaceted retrieval result: the mutual reinforcement rank of a graph node, the uncertainty of each rank, and the propagation of uncertainty among different graph nodes. To illustrate the three facets, we have also designed a composite visualization with three visual components: a graph visualization, an uncertainty glyph, and a flow map. The graph visualization with glyphs, the flow map, and the uncertainty analysis together enable analysts to effectively find the most uncertain results and interactively refine them.

These directed networks have strong structural characteristics: out-degrees with a scale-free distribution, in-degrees bound by a low maximum, and few and small cycles. Standard visualization techniques, such as node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, are impeded by these network characteristics. The scale-free distribution of out-degrees causes a high number of intersecting edges in node-link diagrams. Adjacency matrices become space-inefficient due to the low in-degrees and the resulting sparse network. Compressed adjacency matrices, however, exploit these structural characteristics. By cutting open and rearranging an adjacency matrix, we achieve a compact and neatly-arranged visualization. Compressed adjacency matrices allow for easy detection of subnetworks with a specific structure, so-called motifs, which provide important knowledge about gene regulatory networks to domain experts. We summarize motifs commonly referred to in the literature, and relate them to network analysis tasks common to the visualization domain. We show that a user can easily find the important motifs in compressed adjacency matrices, and that this is hard in standard adjacency matrix and node-link diagrams. We also demonstrate that interaction techniques for standard adjacency matrices can be used for our compressed variant. These techniques include rearrangement clustering, highlighting, and filtering.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327251","Network;gene regulation;scale-free;adjacency matrix","Visualization;Computer aided manufacturing;Standards;Sparse matrices;Layout;Bismuth;Proteins","biology computing;data visualisation;genetics;matrix algebra;network theory (graphs)","compressed adjacency matrices;gene regulatory networks;directed networks;structural characteristics;scale-free distribution;standard visualization;node-link diagrams;network characteristics;sparse network;neatly-arranged visualization;motifs;visualization domain;standard adjacency matrix;rearrangement clustering","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Gene Regulatory Networks;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","36","1","43","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to avoid that the map partly gets too dense, cartographers have designed mapping functions that enlarge a user-defined focus region - such functions are sometimes called fish-eye projections. The extra map space occupied by the enlarged focus region is compensated by distorting other parts of the map. We argue that, in a map showing a network of roads relevant to the user, distortion should preferably take place in those areas where the network is sparse. Therefore, we do not apply a predefined mapping function. Instead, we consider the road network as a graph whose edges are the road segments. We compute a new spatial mapping with a graph-based optimization approach, minimizing the square sum of distortions at edges. Our optimization method is based on a convex quadratic program (CQP); CQPs can be solved in polynomial time. Important requirements on the output map are expressed as linear inequalities. In particular, we show how to forbid edge crossings. We have implemented our method in a prototype tool. For instances of different sizes, our method generated output maps that were far less distorted than those generated with a predefined fish-eye projection. Future work is needed to automate the selection of roads relevant to the user. Furthermore, we aim at fast heuristics for application in real-time systems.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065023","Cartography;schematic maps;fish-eye view;graph drawing;optimization;quadratic programming.","Cartography;Optimization;Image analysis;Visualization;Distortion measurement;Graphics;Quadratic programming","cartography;convex programming;graph theory;mobile computing;polynomials;quadratic programming;real-time systems;traffic information systems","road networks;mobile maps user;cartographer;user defined focus region;fish-eye projection;map distortion;mapping function;convex quadratic program;polynomial time solution;linear inequalities;edge crossings;prototype tool;real-time system;graph drawing","","36","","33","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most common visual representation of provenance data is the node-link diagram. While effective for understanding local activity, the node-link diagram fails to offer a high-level summary of activity and inter-relationships within the data. We present a new tool, InProv, which displays filesystem provenance with an interactive radial-based tree layout. The tool also utilizes a new time-based hierarchical node grouping method for filesystem provenance data we developed to match the user's mental model and make data exploration more intuitive. We compared InProv to a conventional node-link based tool, Orbiter, in a quantitative evaluation with real users of filesystem provenance data including provenance data experts, IT professionals, and computational scientists. We also compared in the evaluation our new node grouping method to a conventional method. The results demonstrate that InProv results in higher accuracy in identifying system activity than Orbiter with large complex data sets. The results also show that our new time-based hierarchical node grouping method improves performance in both tools, and participants found both tools significantly easier to use with the new time-based node grouping method. Subjective measures show that participants found InProv to require less mental activity, less physical activity, less work, and is less stressful to use.

This paper proposes a new approach to graph layout through the use of space filling curves which is very fast and guarantees that there will be no nodes that are colocated. The resulting layout is also aesthetic and satisfies several criteria for graph layout effectiveness.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.158","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658143","Index Termsâ;Information visualization;Graph layout;Space filling curves","Filling;Clustering algorithms;Data visualization;Computational complexity;Social network services;Lenses;Tree graphs","computational complexity;data visualisation;graph theory","node-link diagrams;space filling curves;graph layout;computational complexity;node colocation;graph visualization","","36","","34","","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This representation encodes the spatial relationships of the extrema of a scalar field together with the local volume and nesting structure of the surrounding contours. Unlike other topological representations, such as contour trees, our approach preserves the local geometric structure of the scalar field, including structural cycles that are useful for exposing symmetries in the data. To obtain this representation, we describe a novel mechanism based on the extraction of extremum graphsâsparse subsets of the Morse-Smale complex that retain the important structural information without the clutter and occlusion problems that arise from visualizing the entire complex directly. Extremum graphs form a natural multiresolution structure that allows the user to suppress noise and enhance topological features via the specification of a persistence range. Applications of our approach include the visualization of 3D scalar fields without occlusion artifacts, and the exploratory analysis of high-dimensional functions.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064947","Scalar field topology;topological spine;extremum graph;Morse-Smale complex.","Topology;Data visualization;Approximation methods;Manifolds","computational geometry;data visualisation;graph theory;natural sciences computing","topological spines;structure preserving visual representation;scalar fields;geometric structure;contour trees;extremum graphs;Morse-Smale complex;occlusion problems;clutter problems","","36","","36","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose to organize a timevarying data set into a hierarchy of states. By deriving transition probabilities among states, we construct a global map that captures the essential transition relationships in the time-varying data. We introduce the TransGraph, a graph-based representation to visualize hierarchical state transition relationships. The TransGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts data evolution over time in different levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides data exploration and tracking. The user interacts with the TransGraph and makes connection to the volumetric data through brushing and linking. A set of intuitive queries is provided to enable knowledge extraction from time-varying data. We test our approach with time-varying data sets of different characteristics and the results show that the TransGraph can effectively augment our ability in understanding time-varying data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064965","Time-varying data visualization;hierarchical representation;states;transition relationship;user interface.","Data visualization;Hierarchical systems;Histograms;Data mining;User interfaces","data analysis;data mining;data structures;data visualisation;graph theory;probability","time-varying volumetric data analysis;data visualization;occlusion free;transition probability;TransGraph;graph based representation;hierarchical state transition relationships;visual mapping;navigation tool;knowledge extraction","","36","","30","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present the results of three user studies that investigate how sampling strategies influence node-link visualizations of graphs. In particular, five sampling strategies widely used in the graph mining literature are tested to determine how well they preserve visual features in node-link diagrams.

Today, isosurfaces are most often visualized by extracting a polygonal approximation that is then rendered via graphics hardware or by using a special variant of preintegrated volume rendering. However, these approaches have a number of limitations in terms of the quality of the isosurface, lack of performance for complex data sets, or supported shading models. An alternative isosurface rendering method that does not suffer from these limitations is to directly ray trace the isosurface. However, this approach has been much too slow for interactive applications unless massively parallel shared-memory supercomputers have been used. In this paper, we implement interactive isosurface ray tracing on commodity desktop PCs by building on recent advances in real-time ray tracing of polygonal scenes and using those to improve isosurface ray tracing performance as well. The high performance and scalability of our approach will be demonstrated with several practical examples, including the visualization of highly complex isosurface data sets, the interactive rendering of hybrid polygonal/isosurface scenes, including high-quality ray traced shading effects, and even interactive global illumination on isosurfaces.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1471693","Index Terms- Ray tracing;real-time rendering;isosurface;visualization;global illumination.","Isosurfaces;Ray tracing;Rendering (computer graphics);Data visualization;Layout;Data mining;Graphics;Hardware;Supercomputers;Personal communication networks","ray tracing;rendering (computer graphics);data visualisation;solid modelling;interactive systems;real-time systems;computational geometry;lighting;computer graphic equipment;tree data structures","interactive isosurface ray tracing;implicit KD-trees;high-quality isosurface visualization;polygonal approximation;interactive isosurface rendering;graphics hardware;volume rendering;isosurface quality;shading model;parallel shared-memory supercomputer;real-time ray tracing;polygonal scenes;interactive global illumination;real-time rendering","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","35","4","35","","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analysis of urban forms can help planners develop high-quality urban spaces through evidence-based design. However, such analysis is complex because of the involvement of spatial, multi-scale (i.e., city, region, and street), and multivariate (e.g., greenery and sky ratios) natures of urban forms. In addition, current methods either lack quantitative measurements or are limited to a small area. The primary contribution of this work is the design of StreetVizor, an interactive visual analytics system that helps planners leverage their domain knowledge in exploring human-scale urban forms based on street view images. Our system presents two-stage visual exploration: 1) an AOI Explorer for the visual comparison of spatial distributions and quantitative measurements in two areas-of-interest (AOIs) at city- and region-scales; 2) and a Street Explorer with a novel parallel coordinate plot for the exploration of the fine-grained details of the urban forms at the street-scale. We integrate visualization techniques with machine learning models to facilitate the detection of street view patterns.

We present Temporal Summary Images (TSIs) as an approach for both exploring this data and creating stories from it. As a visualization, a TSI is composed of three common components: (1) a temporal layout, (2) comic strip-style data snapshots, and (3) textual annotations. To augment user analysis and exploration, we have developed a number of interactive techniques that recommend relevant data features and design choices, including an automatic annotations workflow.

We describe a method that allows these types of comprehensive layouts. We achieve it by combining two similarity matrices typically used in isolation - the matrix encoding the similarity of the attributes and the matrix encoding the similarity of the data points. This combined matrix yields two of the four submatrices needed for a full multi-dimensional scaling type layout. The remaining two submatrices are obtained by creating a fused similarity matrix - one that measures the similarity of the data points with respect to the attributes, and vice versa. The resulting layout places the data objects in direct context of the attributes and hence we call it the data context map. It allows users to simultaneously appreciate (1) the similarity of data objects, (2) the similarity of attributes in the specific scope of the collection of data objects, and (3) the relationships of data objects with attributes and vice versa. The contextual layout also allows data regions to be segmented and labeled based on the locations of the attributes. This enables, for example, the map's application in selection tasks where users seek to identify one or more data objects that best fit a certain configuration of factors, using the map to visually balance the tradeoffs.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467552","NSF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194836","High Dimensional Data;Low-Dimensional Embedding;Visual Analytics,;Decision Make;Tradeoffs,;High Dimensional Data;Low-Dimensional Embedding;Visual Analytics;Decision Make;Tradeoffs","Layout;Context;Measurement;Correlation;Optimization;Data visualization;Symmetric matrices","data visualisation;encoding;matrix algebra;sensor fusion","data context map;data fusion;unified display;data matrix visualization;similarity encoding;submatrices;multidimensional scaling type layout;similarity matrix fusion","","35","","37","IEEE","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system utilizes a new range imaging concept called multipeak range imaging, which stores multiple candidates of range measurements for each point on the object surface. The multiple measurements include the erroneous range data caused by various surface properties that are not ideal for structured-light range sensing. False measurements generated by spurious reflections are eliminated by applying a series of constraint tests. The constraint tests based on local surface and local sensor visibility are applied first to individual range images. The constraint tests based on global consistency of coordinates and visibility are then applied to all range images acquired from different viewpoints. We show the effectiveness of our method by constructing 3D models of five different optically challenging objects. To evaluate the performance of the constraint tests and to examine the effects of the parameters used in the constraint tests, we acquired the ground-truth data by painting those objects to suppress the surface-related properties that cause difficulties in range sensing.

However, any particular drawing approach cannot fully satisfy all these criteria simultaneously, producing drawings with visual ambiguities that can impede the understanding of network structure. To bring attention to these potentially problematic areas present in the drawing, this paper presents a technique that highlights common types of visual ambiguities: ambiguous spatial relationships between nodes and edges, visual overlap between community structures, and ambiguity in edge bundling and metanodes. Metrics, including newly proposed metrics for abnormal edge lengths, visual overlap in community structures and node/edge aggregation, are proposed to quantify areas of ambiguity in the drawing. These metrics and others are then displayed using a heatmap-based visualization that provides visual feedback to developers of graph drawing and visualization approaches, allowing them to quickly identify misleading areas.

They reduce the complexity of the overall biological network by partitioning it into smaller manageable parts. While this reduction of complexity is their biggest strength, it is, at the same time, their biggest weakness. By removing what is deemed not important for the primary function of the pathway, biologists lose the ability to follow and understand cross-talks between pathways. Considering these cross-talks is, however, critical in many analysis scenarios, such as judging effects of drugs. In this paper we introduce Entourage, a novel visualization technique that provides contextual information lost due to the artificial partitioning of the biological network, but at the same time limits the presented information to what is relevant to the analyst's task. We use one pathway map as the focus of an analysis and allow a larger set of contextual pathways. For these context pathways we only show the contextual subsets, i.e., the parts of the graph that are relevant to a selection. Entourage suggests related pathways based on similarities and highlights parts of a pathway that are interesting in terms of mapped experimental data. We visualize interdependencies between pathways using stubs of visual links, which we found effective yet not obtrusive. By combining this approach with visualization of experimental data, we can provide domain experts with a highly valuable tool. We demonstrate the utility of Entourage with case studies conducted with a biochemist who researches the effects of drugs on pathways. We show that the technique is well suited to investigate interdependencies between pathways and to analyze, understand, and predict the effect that drugs have on different cell types.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634190","Drugs;Portals;Context awareness;Biological system modeling;Data visualization;Bioinformatics;biomolecular data;Pathway visualization;biological networks;subsets;graphs","Drugs;Portals;Context awareness;Biological system modeling;Data visualization;Bioinformatics","biology computing;data analysis;data visualisation","biological pathway map visualization;contextual subsets;biological network complexity;pathway cross-talks;Entourage visualization technique;biological network;experimental data visualization;biological pathway relationship","Algorithms;Animals;Biopolymers;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Biological;Signal Transduction;User-Computer Interface","34","2","33","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following an iterative development process, we first developed and evaluated a basic hierarchical pie menu system. To better understand how pie menus should be operated in IVEs, we tested this system in a pilot user study with 24 participants and focus on item selection. Regarding the results of the study, the system was tweaked and elements like check boxes, sliders, and color map editors were added to provide extended functionality.

It repeats the process of generating rectangles that enclose the lower-level rectangles until the highest-level rectangles are packed. We present two rectangle-packing algorithms for placing items of hierarchical data onto display spaces. The algorithms refer to Delaunay triangular meshes connecting the centers of rectangles to find gaps where rectangles can be placed. The first algorithm places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the extension of the layout area is minimal. The second algorithm places rectangles by referring to templates describing the ideal positions for nodes of input data. It places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the combination of the layout area and the distances between the positions described in the template and the actual positions is minimal.

While being able to exploit the massive parallelism on the GPU, the BFS order also consumes excessive GPU memory, which becomes a serious issue for interactive applications involving very complex models with more than a few million triangles. In this paper, we propose to use the partial breadth-first search (PBFS) construction order to control memory consumption while maximizing performance. We apply the PBFS order to two hierarchy construction algorithms. The first algorithm is for kd-trees that automatically balances between the level of parallelism and intermediate memory usage. With PBFS, peak memory consumption during construction can be efficiently controlled without costly CPU-GPU data transfer. We also develop memory allocation strategies to effectively limit memory fragmentation. The resulting algorithm scales well with GPU memory and constructs kd-trees of models with millions of triangles at interactive rates on GPUs with 1 GB memory. Compared with existing algorithms, our algorithm is an order of magnitude more scalable for a given GPU memory bound. The second algorithm is for out-of-core bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) construction for very large scenes based on the PBFS construction order. At each iteration, all constructed nodes are dumped to the CPU memory, and the GPU memory is freed for the next iteration's use. In this way, the algorithm is able to build trees that are too large to be stored in the GPU memory. Experiments show that our algorithm can construct BVHs for scenes with up to 20 M triangles, several times larger than previous GPU algorithms.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.88","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5648735","Memory bound;kd-tree;bounding volume hierarchy.","Graphics processing unit;Memory management;Algorithm design and analysis;Parallel processing;Ray tracing;Layout;Shape","computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;storage management;tree searching","GPU spatial hierarchy construction;graphics processing unit;breadth-first search construction order;memory consumption;kd-trees algorithm;memory allocation strategy;bounding volume hierarchy construction;memory-scalable GPU","","34","","16","","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing converging discrete LBO for point clouds, as proposed by Belkin et al. [CHECK END OF SENTENCE], is not guaranteed to be symmetrizable. We build a new point-wisely discrete LBO over the point-sampled surface that is guaranteed to be symmetrizable, and prove its convergence. By solving the eigen problem related to the new operator, we define a set of orthogonal bases over the point cloud. Experiments show that the new operator is converging better than other symmetrizable discrete Laplacian operators (such as graph Laplacian) defined on point-sampled surfaces, and can provide orthogonal bases for further spectral geometric analysis and processing tasks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6264046","Point-sampled surface;Laplace-Beltrami operator;eigenfunction.","Manifolds;Symmetric matrices;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Harmonic analysis;Convergence;Laplace equations;Approximation methods","","","","34","","39","","9 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the task we studied, point-based spatializations were far superior to landscapes, and 2D landscapes were superior to 3D landscapes. Little or no benefit was found for redundantly encoding data using colour or greyscale combined with landscape height. 3D landscapes with no colour scale (height-only) were particularly slow and inaccurate. A colour scale was found to be better than a greyscale for all display types, but a greyscale was helpful compared to height-only.

Causation is related to correlation but correlation does not imply causation. While a number of casual discovery algorithms have been devised that eliminate spurious correlations from a network, there are no guarantees that all of the inferred causations are indeed true. Hence, bringing a domain expert into the casual reasoning loop can be of great benefit in identifying erroneous casual relationships suggested by the discovery algorithm. To address this need we present the Visual Causal Analyst - a novel visual causal reasoning framework that allows users to apply their expertise, verify and edit causal links, and collaborate with the causal discovery algorithm to identify a valid causal network. Its interface consists of both an interactive 2D graph view and a numerical presentation of salient statistical parameters, such as regression coefficients, p-values, and others. Both help users in gaining a good understanding of the landscape of causal structures particularly when the number of variables is large. Our framework is also novel in that it can handle both numerical and categorical variables within one unified model and return plausible results. We demonstrate its use via a set of case studies using multiple practical datasets.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467931","NSF(grant numbers:1117132); MSIP (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning), Korea; ICT Consilience Creative Program; IITP (Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion); US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Basic Energy Sciences; Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences; DOE's OBER at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL); US DOE by Battelle Memorial Institute(grant numbers:DE-AC06-76RLO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192729","Visual knowledge discovery;Causality;Hypothesis testing;Visual evidence;High-dimensional data;Visual knowledge discovery;Causality;Hypothesis testing;Visual evidence;High-dimensional data","Correlation;Visualization;Layout;Linear regression;Optimization;Inference algorithms","data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;inference mechanisms;statistical testing","categorical variables;numerical variables;interactive 2D graph view;salient statistical parameters;casual discovery algorithms;data analytics;multivariate dataset;causal reasoning framework;visual causality analyst","","34","1","31","IEEE","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Edge-bundling techniques are designed to reduce edge clutter in node-link diagrams by coalescing lines into common paths or bundles. Unfortunately, traditional bundling techniques introduce ambiguity since edges are only bundled by spatial proximity, rather than network connectivity; following an edge from its source to its target can lead to the perception of incorrect connectivity if edges are not clearly separated within the bundles. Contrary, CDs bundle edges based on common sources or targets. Thus, a smooth path along a confluent bundle indicates precise connectivity. While CDs have been described in theory, practical investigation and application to real-world networks (i.e., networks beyond those with certain planarity restrictions) is currently lacking. Here, we provide the first algorithm for constructing CDs from arbitrary directed and undirected networks and present a simple layout method, embedded in a sand box environment providing techniques for interactive exploration. We then investigate patterns and artifacts in CDs, which we compare to other common edge-bundling techniques. Finally, we present the first user study that compares edge-compression techniques, including CD, power graphs, metro-style, and common edge bundling. We found that users without particular expertise in visualization or network analysis are able to read small CDs without difficulty. Compared to existing bundling techniques, CDs are more likely to allow people to correctly perceive connectivity.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7539373","Network visualization;edge compression;confluent;power graph;bundling","Visualization;Clutter;Layout;Australia;Topology;Systematics;Complex networks","data visualisation;graph theory","unambiguous edge bundling;network visualization;confluent drawings;node-link diagrams;network connectivity;edge-bundling techniques;edge clutter;coalescing lines;spatial proximity;undirected networks;layout method;sand box environment;interactive exploration;edge-compression techniques;power graphs;metro-style;network analysis","","34","","45","IEEE","10 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This often leads to inadequate artistic control. Moreover, brush stroke orientation is typically assumed to follow an everywhere continuous directional field. In this paper, we propose a video painting system that accounts for the spatial support of objects in the images or videos, and uses this information to specify style parameters and stroke orientation for painterly rendering. Since objects occupy distinct image locations and move relatively smoothly from one video frame to another, our object-based painterly rendering approach is characterized by style parameters that coherently vary in space and time. Space-time-varying style parameters enable more artistic freedom, such as emphasis/de-emphasis, increase or decrease of contrast, exaggeration or abstraction of different objects in the scene in a temporally coherent fashion.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5406517","Nonphotorealistic rendering;video painting;multistyle painting;tensor field design.","Painting;Rendering (computer graphics);Layout;Focusing;Computer Society;Tensile stress;Stress control;Brushes;Constraint optimization","art;rendering (computer graphics);video signal processing","video painting system;space-time-varying style parameters;video painterly rendering;brush stroke orientation;object-based painterly rendering approach;artistic freedom","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer-Aided Design;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Paintings;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Space Perception;User-Computer Interface;Video Recording","34","2","32","","5 Feb 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, we often combine egocentric visualizations with more abstract illustrations based on an outside view in order to provide several presentations of the same phenomenon. Although our visualization tools often build upon existing methods and implementations, the underlying techniques have been improved by several novel technical contributions like image-based special relativistic rendering on GPUs, special relativistic 4D ray tracing for accelerating scene objects, an extension of general relativistic ray tracing to manifolds described by multiple charts, GPU-based interactive visualization of gravitational light deflection, as well as planetary terrain rendering.

The segmentation algorithm for geometry operates directly on the point cloud from multiple registered 3D range images instead of a reconstructed mesh. It is a top-down algorithm which recursively partitions a point set into two subsets using a pairwise similarity measure. The result is a binary tree with individual surfaces as leaves. Our image registration technique performs a very efficient search to automatically find the camera poses for arbitrary position and orientation relative to the geometry.

It exploits information from connected eye-trackers embedded in the next generation of VR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). The proposed solution aims to deliver high visual quality, in real time, around the users' fixations points while lowering the quality everywhere else. The goal of the proposed approach is to substantially reduce the overall bandwidth requirements for supporting VR video experiences while delivering high levels of user perceived quality. The prerequisites to achieve these results are: (1) mechanisms that can cope with different degrees of latency in the system and (2) solutions that support fast adaptation of video quality in different parts of a frame, without requiring a large increase in bitrate. A novel codec configuration, capable of supporting near-instantaneous video quality adaptation in specific portions of a video frame, is presented. The proposed method exploits in-built properties of HEVC encoders and while it introduces a moderate amount of error, these errors are indetectable by users. Fast adaptation is the key to enable gaze-aware streaming and its reduction in bandwidth. A testbed implementing gaze-aware streaming, together with a prototype HMD with in-built eye tracker, is presented and was used for testing with real users. The studies quantified the bandwidth savings achievable by the proposed approach and characterize the relationships between Quality of Experience (QoE) and network latency. The results showed that up to 83% less bandwidth is required to deliver high QoE levels to the users, as compared to conventional solutions.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794119","Vinnova; Tobii; Ericsson; KTH; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8269373","Eye-tracking;VR;QoE;video streaming;content delivery","Streaming media;Bandwidth;Quality of experience;Visualization;Bit rate;Rendering (computer graphics);Servers","helmet mounted displays;quality of experience;video codecs;video coding;video streaming;virtual reality","HEVC encoders;quality of experience;HMD;VR head mounted displays;mobile VR video experiences;eye tracker;codec configuration;gaze-aware streaming solutions;high QoE levels;near-instantaneous video quality adaptation;user perceived quality;video streaming services;content delivery","","33","","38","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An integer called the period jump is associated to each edge of the triangulation to remove the ambiguity when interpolating the direction of the vector field between two facets that share an edge. To interpolate the vector field, we first linearly interpolate the angle of rotation of the vectors along the edges of the facet graph. Then, we use a variant of Nielson's side-vertex scheme to interpolate the vector field over the entire surface. With our representation, we remove the bound imposed on the complexity of singularities that a vertex can represent by its connectivity. This bound is a limitation generally exists in vertex-based linear schemes. Furthermore, using our data structure, the index of a vertex of a vector field can be combinatorily determined","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4015497","vector field visualization;higher-order singularities;line integral convolution;GPU","Vectors;Piecewise linear techniques;Topology;Interpolation;Data structures;Computational fluid dynamics;Data visualization;Integral equations;Convolution;Computational modeling","computational complexity;computational geometry;data visualisation;graph theory;interpolation;vectors","higher-order singularity representation;vector fields;piecewise linear surfaces;interpolation scheme;arbitrary triangulated surface;facet graph;Nielson side-vertex scheme","Bayes Theorem;Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic;Humans;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Research Design;Stomach Neoplasms","33","","32","","20 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a multi-stage Visual Analytics (VA) approach for iterative cluster refinement together with an implementation (SOMFlow) that uses Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to analyze time series data. It supports exploration by offering the analyst a visual platform to analyze intermediate results, adapt the underlying computations, iteratively partition the data, and to reflect previous analytical activities. The history of previous decisions is explicitly visualized within a flow graph, allowing to compare earlier cluster refinements and to explore relations. We further leverage quality and interestingness measures to guide the analyst in the discovery of useful patterns, relations, and data partitions.

Partition-based methods are efficient means in realizing this objective. Although some algorithms exist for support-free fabrication of solid models, no algorithm ever considers the problem of support-free fabrication for shell models (i.e., hollowed meshes). In this paper, we present a skeleton-based algorithm for partitioning a 3D surface model into the least number of parts for 3D printing without using any support structure. To achieve support-free fabrication while minimizing the effect of the seams and cracks that are inevitably induced by the partition, which affect the aesthetics and strength of the final assembled surface, we put forward an optimization system with the minimization of the number of partitions and the total length of the cuts, under the constraints of support-free printing angle. Our approach is particularly tailored for shell models, and it can be applicable to solid models as well. We first rigorously show that the optimization problem is NP-hard and then propose a stochastic method to find an optimal solution to the objectives. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for a special case when the skeleton graph satisfies the requirement that the number of partitioned parts and the degree of each node are bounded by a small constant. We evaluate our partition method on a number of 3D models and validate our method by 3D printing experiments.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2767047","Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:16YF1405500); Shanghai Jiao Tong University(grant numbers:AF0200163); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Systems and Vibration(grant numbers:MSVZD201505); The National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51605290,61502306); China Young 1000 Talents Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8086214","3D printing;skeleton;model partition;support-free","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Fabrication;Three-dimensional printing;Skeleton;Computational modeling","computational complexity;graph theory;optimisation;solid modelling;three-dimensional printing","support-free 3D printing;support structures minimization;skeleton graph;polynomial-time algorithm;support-free printing angle;3D surface model;skeleton-based algorithm;solid models;support-free fabrication;partition-based methods;partitioning models","","33","","58","IEEE","27 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, classifying data points as noise in order to reduce a data set bears special relevance for many application domains. Standard methods such as clustering serve to reduce problem complexity by providing the user with classes of similar entities. However, they usually do not highlight relations between different entities and require a stopping criterion, e.g. the number of clusters to be detected. In this paper, we present a visualization pipeline based on recent advancements in algebraic topology. More precisely, we employ methods from persistent homology that enable topological data analysis on high-dimensional data sets. Our pipeline inherently copes with noisy data and data sets of arbitrary dimensions. It extracts central structures of a data set in a hierarchical manner by using a persistence-based filtering algorithm that is theoretically well-founded. We furthermore introduce persistence rings, a novel visualization technique for a class of topological features-the persistence intervals-of large data sets. Persistence rings provide a unique topological signature of a data set, which helps in recognizing similarities. In addition, we provide interactive visualization techniques that assist the user in evaluating the parameter space of our method in order to extract relevant structures. We describe and evaluate our analysis pipeline by means of two very distinct classes of data sets: First, a class of synthetic data sets containing topological objects is employed to highlight the interaction capabilities of our method. Second, in order to affirm the utility of our technique, we analyse a class of high-dimensional real-world data sets arising from current research in cultural heritage.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327243","Topological persistence;multivariate data;clustering","Network topology;Clustering methods;Multivariate data sets","data analysis;data structures;data visualisation;history;information filtering;pattern classification;topology","multivariate data analysis;topological signatures;significant structures extraction;arbitrary high-dimensional data sets;data points classification;problem complexity;stopping criterion;visualization pipeline;algebraic topology;persistent homology;topological data analysis;noisy data;central structures;hierarchical manner;persistence-based filtering algorithm;persistence rings;topological features;large data sets;interactive visualization techniques;parameter space evaluation;relevant structures;analysis pipeline;synthetic data sets;topological objects;interaction capability;high-dimensional real-world data sets;cultural heritage","","32","","40","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From a very high level, PLP amounts to a modification of a simple view-frustum culling algorithm, however, it requires the computation of a special occupancy-based tessellation and the assignment to each cell of the tessellation a solidity value, which is used to compute a special ordering on how primitives get projected. The authors detail the PLP algorithm, its main components, and implementation.

This is because objects within the same community usually have at least one property in common. The investigation of community structure can therefore support the understanding of object attributes from the network topology alone. In real-world systems, objects may belong to several communities at the same time, i.e., communities can overlap. Analyzing fuzzy community memberships is essential to understand to what extent objects contribute to different communities and whether some communities are highly interconnected. We developed a visualization approach that is based on node-link diagrams and supports the investigation of fuzzy communities in weighted undirected graphs at different levels of detail. Starting with the network of communities, the user can continuously drill down to the network of individual nodes and finally analyze the membership distribution of nodes of interest. Our approach uses layout strategies and further visual mappings to graphically encode the fuzzy community memberships. The usefulness of our approach is illustrated by two case studies analyzing networks of different domains: social networking and biological interactions. The case studies showed that our layout and visualization approach helps investigate fuzzy overlapping communities.

In this context, we propose a novel contouring algorithm for the construction of a discrete Reeb graph with a minimal number of nodes, which correspond to the critical points of f (i.e., minima, maxima, and saddle points) and its level sets passing through the saddle points. In this way, we do not need to sample, sweep, or increasingly sort the f-values. Since most of the computation uses only local information on the mesh connectivity, equipped with the f-values at the surface vertices, the proposed approach is insensitive to noise and requires a small-memory footprint and temporary data structures. Furthermore, we maintain the parametric nature of the Reeb graph with respect to the input scalar function and we efficiently extract the Reeb graph of time-varying maps. Indicating with n and s the number of vertices of M and saddle points of f, the overall computational cost O(sn) is competitive with respect to the O(n log n) cost of previous work. This cost becomes optimal if M is highly sampled or s les log n, as it happens for Laplacian eigenfunctions, harmonic maps, and one-forms.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770097","Reeb graph;topological graph;Morse theory;computational topology;geometric algorithms;hierarchical segmentations;shape analysis and abstraction.","Shape;Level set;Topology;Data structures;Data mining;Computational efficiency;Cost function;Laplace equations;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Algorithm design and analysis","computational complexity;data structures;graph theory","minimal contouring algorithm;discrete Reeb graph;continuous scalar function;high-level descriptor;saddle point;critical point;small-memory footprint;temporary data structure;time-varying map;Laplacian eigenfunction;harmonic map;mesh connectivity;surface vertex","","31","","54","","2 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We only consider techniques that offer a lossless compression: that is, where the entire graph can still be read from the compressed version. The techniques considered are: a simple grouping of nodes with identical neighbor sets; Modular Decomposition which permits internal structure in modules and allows them to be nested; and Power Graph Analysis which further allows edges to cross module boundaries. These techniques all have the same goal-to compress the set of edges that need to be rendered to fully convey connectivity-but each successive relaxation of the module definition permits fewer edges to be drawn in the rendered graph. Each successive technique also, we hypothesize, requires a higher degree of mental effort to interpret. We test this hypothetical trade-off with two studies involving human participants. For Power Graph Analysis we propose a novel optimal technique based on constraint programming. This enables us to explore the parameter space for the technique more precisely than could be achieved with a heuristic.

In this paper, we present a novel visualization technique called route-zooming that can embed spatio-temporal information into a map seamlessly for occlusion-free visualization of both spatial and temporal data. The proposed technique can broaden a selected route in a map by deforming the overall road network. We formulate the problem of route-zooming as a nonlinear least squares optimization problem by defining an energy function that ensures the route is broadened successfully on demand while the distortion caused to the road network is minimized. The spatio-temporal information can then be embedded into the route to reveal both spatial and temporal patterns without occluding the spatial context information.

The software to drive them needs to scale too if arbitrarily large displays are to be built. Chromium is a popular software API used to construct such displays. Chromium transparently renders any OpenGL application to a tiled display by partitioning and sending individual OpenGL primitives to each client per frame. Visualization applications often deal with massive geometric data with millions of primitives. Transmitting them every frame results in huge network requirements that adversely affect the scalability of the system. In this paper, we present Garuda, a client-server-based display wall framework that uses off-the-shelf hardware and a standard network. Garuda is scalable to large tile configurations and massive environments. It can transparently render any application built using the Open Scene Graph (OSG) API to a tiled display without any modification by the user. The Garuda server uses an object-based scene structure represented using a scene graph. The server determines the objects visible to each display tile using a novel adaptive algorithm that culls the scene graph to a hierarchy of frustums. Required parts of the scene graph are transmitted to the clients, which cache them to exploit the interframe redundancy. A multicast-based protocol is used to transmit the geometry to exploit the spatial redundancy present in tiled display systems. A geometry push philosophy from the server helps keep the clients in sync with one another. Neither the server nor a client needs to render the entire scene, making the system suitable for interactive rendering of massive models. Transparent rendering is achieved by intercepting the cull, draw, and swap functions of OSG and replacing them with our own. We demonstrate the performance and scalability of the Garuda system for different configurations of display wall.

Entity resolution, the process of reconciling multiple references to underlying real-world entities, is an important data cleaning process required before accurate visualization or analysis of the data is possible. In many cases, in addition to noisy data describing entities, there is data describing the relationships among the entities. This relational data is important during the entity resolution process; it is useful both for the algorithms which determine likely database references to be resolved and for visual analytic tools which support the entity resolution process. In this paper, we introduce a novel user interface, D-Dupe, for interactive entity resolution in relational data. D-Dupe effectively combines relational entity resolution algorithms with a novel network visualization that enables users to make use of an entity's relational context for making resolution decisions. Since resolution decisions often are interdependent, D-Dupe facilitates understanding this complex process through animations which highlight combined inferences and a history mechanism which allows users to inspect chains of resolution decisions. An empirical study with 12 users confirmed the benefits of the relational context visualization on the performance of entity resolution tasks in relational data in terms of time as well as users' confidence and satisfaction.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4479458","User interfaces;Human-centered computing;Graphical user interfaces;User-centered design;Information visualization;User interfaces;Human-centered computing;Graphical user interfaces;User-centered design;Information visualization","Visual analytics;Data visualization;Relational databases;Visual databases;Cleaning;Data analysis;User interfaces;Inference algorithms;Animation;History","data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;relational databases","interactive entity resolution;visual analytic tool;graphical user interface;D-Dupe;relational entity resolution algorithm;relational context visualization","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;User-Computer Interface","31","5","41","","10 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The majority of previous studies on time-varying word clouds focuses on layout optimization and temporal trend visualization. However, they do not fully consider the spatial shapes and temporal motions of word clouds, which are important factors for attracting people's attention and are also important cues for human visual systems in capturing information from time-varying text data. This paper presents a novel method that uses rigid body dynamics to arrange multi-temporal word-tags in a specific shape sequence under various constraints. Each word-tag is regarded as a rigid body in dynamics. With the aid of geometric, aesthetic, and temporal coherence constraints, the proposed method can generate a temporally morphable word cloud that not only arranges word-tags in their corresponding shapes but also smoothly transforms the shapes of word clouds overtime, thus yielding a pleasing time-varying visualization. Using the proposed frame-by-frame and morphable word clouds, people can observe the overall story of a time-varying text data from the shape transition, and people can also observe the details from the word clouds in frames. Experimental results on various data demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed method in morphable word cloud generation. In addition, an application that uses the proposed word clouds in a simulated exhibition demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed method.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2440241","Headquarters of University Advancement; National Cheng Kung University; Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:MOST-102-2420-H-004-045-MY3,MOST-103-2221-E-004-008,MOST-104-2221-E-006-044-MY3,MOST-103-2221-E-006-106-MY3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118241","word cloud;time-varying text data;digital storytelling;information visualization;Word cloud;time-varying text data;digital storytelling;information visualization","Tag clouds;Virtual reality;Data visualization;Text mining;Interpolation;Market research;Data analysis;Digital systems;Time-varying systems","data visualisation;text analysis;time-varying systems","time-varying text data visualization;text documents visual representation;rigid body dynamics;multitemporal word-tag arrangement;shape sequence;temporally morphable word cloud;frame-by-frame word clouds","Computer Graphics;Data Mining;Humans;Internet;Semantics;Word Processing","31","","27","IEEE","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many projection techniques have been recently proposed addressing different objectives and application domains. Nonetheless, very little is known about the effectiveness of the generated layouts from a user's perspective, how distinct layouts from the same data compare regarding the typical visualization tasks they support, or how domain-specific issues affect the outcome of the techniques. Learning more about projection usage is an important step towards both consolidating their role in high-dimensional data analysis and taking informed decisions when choosing techniques. This work provides a contribution towards this goal. We describe the results of an investigation on the performance of layouts generated by projection techniques as perceived by their users. We conducted a controlled user study to test against the following hypotheses: (1) projection performance is task-dependent; (2) certain projections perform better on certain types of tasks; (3) projection performance depends on the nature of the data; and (4) subjects prefer projections with good segregation capability. We generated layouts of high-dimensional data with five techniques representative of different projection approaches. As application domains we investigated image and document data. We identified eight typical tasks, three of them related to segregation capability of the projection, three related to projection precision, and two related to incurred visual cluttering. Answers to questions were compared for correctness against `ground truth' computed directly from the data. We also looked at subject confidence and task completion times. Statistical analysis of the collected data resulted in Hypotheses 1 and 3 being confirmed, Hypothesis 2 being confirmed partially and Hypotheses 4 could not be confirmed. We discuss our findings in comparison with some numerical measures of projection layout quality. Our results offer interesting insight on the use of projection layouts in data visualization tasks and provide a departing point for further systematic investigations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2330617","VisComX center of the Jacobs University; Brazilian financial agencies CNPq and FAPESP; CAPES/DAAD(grant numbers:34/10); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832613","Projections;dimension reduction;multidimensional data;perception-based evaluation","Layout;Data visualization;Image color analysis;Visualization;Principal component analysis;Extraterrestrial measurements","data analysis;data visualisation;pattern clustering;statistical analysis","perception-based evaluation;projection methods;multidimensional data visualization;similarity-based layout;dimension reduction techniques;user perspective;visualization tasks;projection usage;high-dimensional data analysis;projection performance;image data;document data;projection precision;incurred visual cluttering;ground truth;subject confidence;task completion times;statistical analysis","","31","","45","IEEE","12 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose a novel framework by which to handle complex social streams on a budget PC. This framework features two components: 1) an online method to detect important time periods (i.e., subevents), and 2) a tailored GPU-assisted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method, which clusters the tweets of subevents stably and efficiently. Based on the framework, we present StreamExplorer to facilitate the visual analysis, tracking, and comparison of a social stream at three levels. At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives. Two case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of StreamExplorer.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2764459","National 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB352503); NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization(grant numbers:U1609217); NSFC(grant numbers:61502416,61602409,61672308,61602306); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:LR18F020001); Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(grant numbers:2016QNA5014); 100 Talents Program of Zhejiang University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074775","Social media visualization;visual analytics;social stream;streaming data;self-organizing map","Data visualization;Visualization;Lenses;Monitoring;Electronic mail;Social network services","data visualisation;graphics processing units;self-organising feature maps;social networking (online)","StreamExplorer;complex social streams;multistage system;visually exploring events;crisis management;budget PC;tailored GPU-assisted self-organizing map method;SOM;tweets;macroscopic level;glyph-based timeline visualization;multi-faceted overview;mesoscopic level;map visualization;microscopic level;interactive lenses;task-based evaluation","Computer Graphics;Disease Outbreaks;Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Models, Theoretical;Social Media;Sports;User-Computer Interface","31","","50","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Selecting a âgoodâ layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743858","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1320229,IIS-1528203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8017580","Graph visualization;graph layout;aesthetics;machine learning;graph kernel;graphlet","Kernel;Layout;Measurement;Visualization;Inspection;Data visualization;Support vector machines","data visualisation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","graph kernel;graph look;graph visualization;viewer perceives different information;visual inspection;visual appearances;aesthetic metrics;topological similarity;estimation calculation;perceptual similarity;machine learning","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Esthetics;Female;Humans;Machine Learning;Male;Task Performance and Analysis;Young Adult","31","","92","IEEE","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem occurs, for example, when the user of a mapping service wants to see the names of restaurants or other POIs in a crowded downtown area but keep the overview over a larger area. Our approach is to place the labels at the boundary of the focus region and connect each site with its label by a linear connection, which is called a leader. In this way, we move labels from the focus region to the less valuable context region surrounding it. In order to make the leader layout well readable, we present algorithms that rule out crossings between leaders and optimize other characteristics such as total leader length and distance between labels. This yields a new variant of the boundary labeling problem, which has been studied in the literature. Other than in traditional boundary labeling, where leaders are usually schematized polylines, we focus on leaders that are either straight-line segments or Bezier curves. Further, we present algorithms that, given the sites, find a position of the focus region that optimizes the above characteristics. We also consider a variant of the problem where we have more sites than space for labels. In this situation, we assume that the sites are prioritized by the user. Alternatively, we take a new facility-location perspective which yields a clustering of the sites. We label one representative of each cluster. If the user wishes, we apply our approach to the sites within a cluster, giving details on demand.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327264","Focus+context techniques;data clustering;mobile and ubiquitous visualization;geographic/geospatial visualization","Clustering methods;Gravity;Ubiquitous computing;Labels;Visual analytics;Data visualization;Geospatial analysis","computer graphics;curve fitting;diagrams;pattern clustering","focus region labeling;point site labeling;diagram;mapping service;leader layout;total leader length;boundary labeling problem;polylines;straight-line segment;Bezier curve;facility-location perspective;site clustering","","30","","28","","8 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our method accepts a set of two-dimensional images as input and produces a Cubist style painting with minimal user interaction. We use salient features identified within the image set, such as eyes, noses, and mouths, as compositional elements; we believe the use of such features to be a unique contribution to NPR. Before composing features into a final image, we geometrically distort them to produce the more angular forms common in Cubist art. Finally, we render the composition to give a painterly effect, using an automatic algorithm. This paper describes our method, illustrating the application of our algorithm with a gallery of images.

Characterizing the large scale universe is essential to our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies. The density range of clusters, walls and voids are relatively well separated, when compared to filaments, which span a relatively larger range. The large scale filamentary network thus forms an intricate part of the cosmic web. In this paper, we describe Felix, a topology based framework for visual exploration of filaments in the cosmic web. The filamentary structure is represented by the ascending manifold geometry of the 2-saddles in the Morse-Smale complex of the density field. We generate a hierarchy of Morse-Smale complexes and query for filaments based on the density ranges at the end points of the filaments. The query is processed efficiently over the entire hierarchical Morse-Smale complex, allowing for interactive visualization. We apply Felix to computer simulations based on the heuristic Voronoi kinematic model and the standard ACDM cosmology, and demonstrate its usefulness through two case studies. First, we extract cosmic filaments within and across cluster like regions in Voronoi kinematic simulation datasets. We demonstrate that we produce similar results to existing structure finders. Second, we extract different classes of filaments based on their density characteristics from the ACDM simulation datasets. Filaments that form the spine of the cosmic web, which exist in high density regions in the current epoch, are isolated using Felix. Also, filaments present in void-like regions are isolated and visualized.

On data sets of such scale, classical graph drawing methods do not take advantage of certain human cognitive skills such as shape recognition. These cognitive skills could make it easier to remember the global structure of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that is based on the use of nested irregular shapes. We name it GosperMap as we rely on the use of a Gosper Curve to generate these shapes. By employing human perception mechanisms that were developed by handling, for example, cartographic maps, this technique facilitates the visualization and navigation of a hierarchy. An algorithm has been designed to preserve region containment according to the hierarchy and to set the leaves' sizes proportionally to a property, in such a way that the size of nonleaf regions corresponds to the sum of their children's sizes. Moreover, the input ordering of the hierarchy's nodes is preserved, i.e., the areas that represent two consecutive children of a node in the hierarchy are adjacent to one another. This property is especially useful because it guarantees some stability in our algorithm. We illustrate our technique by providing visualization examples of the repartition of tax money in the US over time. Furthermore, we validate the use of the GosperMap in a professional documentation context and show the stability and ease of memorization for this type of map.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.91","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6532285","Treemap;tree layout;hierarchical data visualization;Gosper curve;concave polygon labeling","Data visualization;Layout;Shape;Visualization;Vegetation;Labeling;Fractals","data visualisation;human factors;tree data structures","GosperMap;Gosper curve;hierarchical data;cognitive skills;global data structure;nested irregular shapes;shape generation;human perception mechanisms;cartographic maps;hierarchy navigation;hierarchy visualization;region containment preservation;leaf region size;nonleaf region size;hierarchy node children size;tax money repartitioning;US;professional documentation context;very large data hierarchies","","30","1","60","","14 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, its practical use often involves a tedious and time-consuming process of tuning parameters and making application-specific choices. In the absence of training data with labeled clusters, help from a human analyst is required to decide the number of clusters, to determine whether hierarchical clustering is needed, and to define the appropriate distance measures, parameters of the underlying graph, and type of graph Laplacian. We propose to simplify this process via an open-box approach, in which an interactive system visualizes the involved mathematical quantities, suggests parameter values, and provides immediate feedback to support the required decisions. Our framework focuses on applications in 3D image analysis, and links the abstract high-dimensional feature space used in spectral clustering to the three-dimensional data space. This provides a better understanding of the technique, and helps the analyst predict how well specific parameter settings will generalize to similar tasks. In addition, our system supports filtering outliers and labeling the final clusters in such a way that user actions can be recorded and transferred to different data in which the same structures are to be found. Our system supports a wide range of inputs, including triangular meshes, regular grids, and point clouds. We use our system to develop segmentation protocols in chest CT and brain MRI that are then successfully applied to other datasets in an automated manner.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634089","Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laplace equations;Image analysis;Data visualization;Clustering;programming with example;Image segmentation;spectral clustering;high-dimensional embeddings;linked views","Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laplace equations;Image analysis;Data visualization;Clustering","biomedical MRI;computerised tomography;data visualisation;graph theory;medical image processing;pattern clustering","open-box spectral clustering;medical image analysis;3D image analysis;tuning parameters;hierarchical clustering;distance measures;graph parameter;Laplacian graph type;three-dimensional data space;segmentation protocols;chest CT;computerised tomography;brain MRI;magnetic resonance imaging","Algorithms;Brain;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","30","2","53","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper revisits this earlier work. Through exploratory pilot studies that expand Cleveland et al.'s experimental design, we develop an empirical model of slope ratio estimation that fits more extreme slope ratio judgments and two common slope ratio estimation strategies. We then run two experiments to validate our model. In the first, we show that our model fits more generally than the one proposed by Cleveland et al. and we find that, in general, slope ratio errors are not minimized around 45Â°. In the second experiment, we explore a novel hypothesis raised by our model: that visible baselines can substantially mitigate errors made in slope judgments.

The key idea in the proposed approach is to maximally leverage the efficient contour tree algorithm to compute the Reeb graph. The algorithm proceeds by dividing the input into a set of subvolumes that have loop-free Reeb graphs using the join tree of the scalar function and computes the Reeb graph by combining the contour trees of all the subvolumes. Since the key ingredient of this method is a series of union-find operations, the algorithm is fast in practice. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms current generic algorithms by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude, and has a performance on par with algorithms that are catered to restricted classes of input.

Such approaches are difficult to apply for cases in which multiple characters are closely interacting with each other, as the relationships of the characters are not encoded in the representation. In this research, we propose a topology-based approach to index the motions of two human characters in close contact. We compute and encode how the two bodies are tangled based on the concept of rational tangles. The encoded relationships, which we define as {\it TangleList}, are used to determine the similarity of the pairs of postures. Using our method, we can index and retrieve motions such as one person piggy-backing another, one person assisting another in walking, and two persons dancing / wrestling. Our method is useful to manage a motion database of multiple characters.

Individual indicators are selected and combined to reflect a phenomena being measured. Visualization of a composite indicator is recommended as a tool to enable interested stakeholders, as well as the public audience, to better understand the indicator components and evolution overtime. However, existing CI visualizations introduce a variety of solutions and there is a lack in CI's visualization guidelines. Radial visualizations are popular among these solutions because of CI's inherent multi-dimensionality. Although in dispute, Radar-charts are often used for CI presentation. However, no empirical evidence on Radar's effectiveness and efficiency for common CI tasks is available. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by reporting on a controlled experiment that compares the Radar chart technique with two other radial visualization methods: Flowercharts as used in the well-known OECD Betterlife index, and Circle-charts which could be adopted for this purpose. Examples of these charts in the current context are shown in Figure 1. We evaluated these charts, showing the same data with each of the mentioned techniques applying small multiple views for different dimensions of the data. We compared users' performance and preference empirically under a formal task-taxonomy. Results indicate that the Radar chart was the least effective and least liked, while performance of the two other options were mixed and dependent on the task. Results also showed strong preference of participants toward the Flower chart.

However, few users are well-versed in the algorithms behind the visualizations, making parameter tweaking more of a guessing game than a series of decisive interactions. Translating user interactions into algorithmic input is a key component of Visual to Parametric Interaction (V2PI) [13]. Instead of adjusting parameters, users directly move data points on the screen, which then updates the underlying statistical model. However, we have found that some data points that are not moved by the user are just as important in the interactions as the data points that are moved. Users frequently move some data points with respect to some other 'unmoved' data points that they consider as spatially contextual. However, in current V2PI interactions, these points are not explicitly identified when directly manipulating the moved points.

However, controlling the outputs of these techniques for design purposes is often notoriously difficult for users due to the large number of parameters involved in these rule sets and also their non-linear relationship to the resulting content. To circumvent this problem, we present a sketch-based approach to procedural modeling. Given an approximate and abstract hand-drawn 2D sketch provided by a user, our algorithm automatically computes a set of procedural model parameters, which in turn yield multiple, detailed output shapes that resemble the user's input sketch. The user can then select an output shape, or further modify the sketch to explore alternative ones. At the heart of our approach is a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained to map sketches to procedural model parameters. The network is trained by large amounts of automatically generated synthetic line drawings. By using an intuitive medium, i.e., freehand sketching as input, users are set free from manually adjusting procedural model parameters, yet they are still able to create high quality content. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of our method in a variety of procedural modeling scenarios including design of man-made and organic shapes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2597830","US National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CHS-1422441,CHS-1617333); NVidia for GPU donations; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530838","Shape synthesis;convolutional neural networks;procedural modeling;sketch-based modeling","Shape;Computational modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Neural networks;Solid modeling;Computer architecture","convolution;data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);shape recognition","shape synthesis;procedural models;high quality visual content;complex rule sets;hand-drawn 2D sketch;deep convolutional neural network;CNN;network training;automatically generated synthetic line drawings;intuitive medium","","29","","48","IEEE","3 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The applicability of this framework is however severely limited by the quadratic complexity of its main computational kernel. In this work, we present an approximation algorithm for CVT with a significantly lower complexity. This new algorithm reduces the runtime by several orders of magnitude and maintains the main advantages of CVT over the continuous approach.

We demonstrate our idea by ways of four visualization pair examples: data table and parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrix and hyperbox, linear chart and spiral chart, and hierarchical pie chart and treemap. The analogy is commutative i.e. any member of the pair can be the unfamiliar visualization. A series of studies showed that this new paradigm can be an effective teaching tool. The participants could understand the unfamiliar visualization methods in all of the four pairs either fully or at least significantly better after they observed or interacted with the transitions from the familiar counterpart.

Typically there is a well-defined notion of distance between pairs of objects, and traditional approaches such as principal component analysis or multi-dimensional scaling are used to place the objects as points in 2D space, so that similar objects are close to each other. In another typical setting, the dataset is visualized as a network graph, where related nodes are connected by links. More recently, datasets are also visualized as maps, where in addition to nodes and links, there is an explicit representation of groups and clusters. We consider these three Techniques, characterized by a progressive increase of the amount of encoded information: node diagrams, node-link diagrams and node-link-group diagrams. We assess these three types of diagrams with a controlled experiment that covers nine different tasks falling broadly in three categories: node-based tasks, network-based tasks and group-based tasks. Our findings indicate that adding links, or links and group representations, does not negatively impact performance (time and accuracy) of node-based tasks. Similarly, adding group representations does not negatively impact the performance of network-based tasks. Node-link-group diagrams outperform the others on group-based tasks. These conclusions contradict results in other studies, in similar but subtly different settings.

The effectiveness of this approach depends on how the visual variables chosen for representing uncertainty and other attributes interact to influence the user's perception of each variable. We report a user study on the perception of graph edge attributes when uncertainty associated with each edge and the main edge attribute are visualized simultaneously using two separate visual variables. The study covers four visual variables that are commonly used for visualizing uncertainty on line graphical primitives: lightness, grain, fuzziness, and transparency. We select width, hue, and saturation for visualizing the main edge attribute and hypothesize that we can observe interference between the visual variable chosen to encode the main edge attribute and that to encode uncertainty, as suggested by the concept of dimensional integrality. Grouping the seven visual variables as color-based, focus-based, or geometry-based, we further hypothesize that the degree of interference is affected by the groups to which the two visual variables belong. We consider two further factors in the study: discriminability level for each visual variable as a factor intrinsic to the visual variables and graph-task type (visual search versus comparison) as a factor extrinsic to the visual variables. Our results show that the effectiveness of a visual variable in depicting uncertainty is strongly mediated by all the factors examined here. Focus-based visual variables (fuzziness, grain, and transparency) are robust to the choice of visual variables for encoding the main edge attribute, though fuzziness has stronger negative impact on the perception of width and transparency has stronger negative impact on the perception of hue than the other uncertainty visual variables. We found that interference between hue and lightness is much greater than that between saturation and lightness, though all three are color-based visual variables. We also found a compound relationship between discriminability level and the degree of dimensional integrality. We discuss the generalizability and limitation of the results and conclude with design considerations for visualizing graph uncertainty derived from these results, including recommended choices of visual variables when the relative importance of data attributes and graph tasks is known.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2424872","IIS(grant numbers:IIS-10-18769); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089294","Visual variable;perception;uncertainty visualization;graph visualization;Visual variable;perception;uncertainty visualization;graph visualization","Visualization;Uncertainty;Encoding;Data visualization;Image color analysis;Accuracy;Interference","computational geometry;data visualisation;graph theory","uncertainty representation;paired-visual variable evaluation;data visualization;user perception;graph edge attributes;line graphical primitives;lightness attribute;grain attribute;fuzziness attribute;transparency attribute;width attribute;hue attribute;saturation attribute;visual variable;uncertainty encoding;dimensional integrality;color-based visual variable;focus-based visual variable;geometry-based visual variable;interference degree;discriminability level;intrinsic factor;graph-task type;focus-based visual variables;color-based visual variables;graph uncertainty visualization;data attributes","","28","","40","IEEE","20 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a novel multifocus technique to achieve this goal, where the foci are defined by points of interest (POI) along the route. A detail lens that encapsulates the POI at a finer geospatial scale is created for each focus. The lenses are laid out on the map to avoid occlusion with the route and each other, and to optimally utilize the free space around the route. We define a set of layout metrics to evaluate the quality of a lens layout for a given route map visualization.

Two orthogonal axes are used: one for all nodes of the displayed graph, the other for the corresponding links. Colors and labels are employed to identify the nodes. The usage of color allows us to scale the visualization to single pixel level for large graphs. In contrast to other techniques, we employ an asymmetric mapping that results in an aligned and compact representation of links. Our approach is independent of the specific properties of the graph to be visualized, but certain graphs and tasks benefit from the asymmetry. As we show in our results, the strength of our technique is the visualization of dynamic graphs. In particular, sparse graphs benefit from the compact representation. Furthermore, our approach uses visual encoding by size to represent weights and therefore allows easy quantification and comparison. We evaluate our approach in a quantitative user study that confirms the suitability for dynamic and weighted graphs. Finally, we demonstrate our approach for two examples of dynamic graphs.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2322594","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6812198","Graph visualization;weighted graphs;dynamic graphs;adjacency lists","Graph theory;Image color analysis;Encoding;Data visualization;Scalability","data visualisation;graph theory","visual encoding;sparse graphs;compact representation;asymmetric mapping;visualization;displayed graph;orthogonal axes;weighted graphs;visual representation;dynamic graphs;visual adjacency lists","","28","","47","IEEE","8 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tracking temporal changes at scale in these networks is challenging due in part to the fact that small changes can be missed or drowned-out by the rest of the network. For static networks, current approaches allow the identification of specific network elements within their context. However, in the case of dynamic networks, the user is left alone with finding salient local network elements and tracking them over time. In this work, we introduce a modular DoI specification to flexibly define what salient changes are and to assign them a measure of their importance in a time-varying setting. The specification takes into account neighborhood structure information, numerical attributes of nodes/edges, and their temporal evolution. A tailored visualization of the DoI specification complements our approach. Alongside a traditional node-link view of the dynamic network, it serves as an interface for the interactive definition of a DoI function. By using it to successively refine and investigate the captured details, it supports the analysis of dynamic networks from an initial view until pinpointing a user's analysis goal. We report on applying our approach to scientific coauthorship networks and give concrete results for the DBLP data set.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574858","Time-varying graphs;dynamic graph visualization;degree-of-interest","Visualization;Context;Data visualization;Radiation detectors;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Navigation","formal specification;graph theory","modular degree-of-interest specification;visual analysis;large dynamic networks;static networks;local network elements;structure information;numerical attributes;temporal evolution;tailored visualization;DoI specification complements;dynamic network;interactive definition","","27","","37","","5 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This significantly impacts the quality of global, low-dimensional space embedding procedures such as the popular multidimensional scaling (MDS) where one can often observe nonintuitive layouts. We were inspired by the perceptual processes evoked in the method of parallel coordinates which enables users to visually aggregate the data by the patterns the polylines exhibit across the dimension axes. We call the path of such a polyline its structure and suggest a metric that captures this structure directly in high-dimensional space. This allows us to better gauge the distances of spatially distant data constellations and so achieve data aggregations in MDS plots that are more cognizant of existing high-dimensional structure similarities. Our biscale framework distinguishes far-distances from near-distances. The coarser scale uses the structural similarity metric to separate data aggregates obtained by prior classification or clustering, while the finer scale employs the appropriate euclidean distance.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560006","Information visualization;multivariate visualization;clustering;high-dimensional data;visual analytics","Layout;Euclidean distance;Correlation;Indexes;Data visualization;Extraterrestrial measurements","computational geometry;data visualisation;embedded systems","structure-based distance metric;high-dimensional space exploration;multidimensional scaling;low-dimensional space embedding procedures;polylines pattern;spatially distant data constellations","","27","","32","","16 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, the problem becomes even more challenging when the dynamic data records have a varying number of dimensions as often found in real-world applications. This paper presents an incremental DR solution. We enhance an existing incremental PCA method in several ways to ensure its usability for visualizing streaming multidimensional data. First, we use geometric transformation and animation methods to help preserve a viewer's mental map when visualizing the incremental results.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for compression of MoCap data, which is based on smart indexing of the MoCap data by exploiting structural information derived from the skeletal virtual human model. The indexing algorithm can be fine-controlled using three predefined quality control parameters (QCPs). We demonstrate how an efficient combination of the three QCPs results in a lower network bandwidth requirement and reduced power consumption for data decompression at the client end when compared to standard MPEG-4 compression.

Successful performance depends on points being visible from at least two cameras and on the accuracy of the triangulation. Triangulation accuracy is strongly related to the positions and orientations of the cameras. Thus, the configuration of the camera network has a critical impact on performance. A poor camera configuration may result in a low quality three-dimensional (3D) estimation and consequently low quality of tracking. This paper introduces and compares two methods for camera placement. The first method is based on a metric that computes target point visibility in the presence of dynamic occlusion from cameras with âgoodâ views. The second method is based on the distribution of views of target points. Efficient algorithms, based on simulated annealing, are introduced for estimating the optimal configuration of cameras for the two metrics and a given distribution of target points.

A key advantage of our method is that it can directly visualize higher-order state transitions. A standard first order state transition is a sequence of two states that are linked by a transition. A higher-order state transition is a sequence of three or more states where the sequence of participating states are linked together by consecutive first order state transitions. Our method extends the current state-graph exploration methods by employing a two dimensional graph, in which higher-order state transitions are visualized as curved lines. All transitions are bundled into thick splines, so that the thickness of an edge represents the frequency of instances. The bundling between two states takes into account the state transitions before and after the transition. This is done in such a way that it forms a continuous representation in which any subsequence of the timeseries is represented by a continuous smooth line. The edge bundles in these graphs can be explored interactively through our incremental selection algorithm. We demonstrate our method with an application in exploring labeled time-series data from a biological survey, where a clustering has assigned a single label to the data at each time-point. In these sequences, a large number of cyclic patterns occur, which in turn are linked to specific activities. We demonstrate how our method helps to find these cycles, and how the interactive selection process helps to find and investigate activities.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290701","State transitions;Graph drawing;Time series;Biological data","Data visualization;Frequency;Clustering algorithms","biology computing;graph theory;splines (mathematics);time series","smooth graphs;higher-order state transitions;state sequences;large observational time series;state-graph exploration methods;splines;biological data","Animals;Behavior, Animal;Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Computer Graphics;Databases, Factual;Spheniscidae;Time Factors","27","1","23","","23 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To register LFs, we use what we call the ray-space motion matrix (RSMM) to establish pairwise ray-ray correspondences. Using PlÃ¼cker coordinates, we show that the RSMM is a 5 x 6 matrix, which reduces to a 5 x 5 matrix under pure translation and/or in-plane rotation. The final LF stitching is done using multi-resolution, high-dimensional graph-cut in order to account for possible scene motion, imperfect RSMM estimation, and/or undersampling.

"Surface Extraction from Multi-field Particle Volume Data Using Multi-dimensional Cluster Visualization","L. Linsen; T. Van Long; P. Rosenthal; S.

It is, therefore, desirable that visualization methods take into account the entire multi-field volume data rather than concentrating on one variable. We present a visualization approach based on surface extraction from multi-field particle volume data. The surfaces segment the data with respect to the underlying multi-variate function. Decisions on segmentation properties are based on the analysis of the multi-dimensional feature space. The feature space exploration is performed by an automated multi-dimensional hierarchical clustering method, whose resulting density clusters are shown in the form of density level sets in a 3D star coordinate layout. In the star coordinate layout, the user can select clusters of interest. A selected cluster in feature space corresponds to a segmenting surface in object space. Based on the segmentation property induced by the cluster membership, we extract a surface from the volume data. Our driving applications are smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, where each particle carries multiple properties. The data sets are given in the form of unstructured point-based volume data. We directly extract our surfaces from such data without prior resampling or grid generation. The surface extraction computes individual points on the surface, which is supported by an efficient neighborhood computation. The extracted surface points are rendered using point-based rendering operations. Our approach combines methods in scientific visualization for object-space operations with methods in information visualization for feature-space operations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.167","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658166","Index Termsâ;Multi-field and multi-variate visualization;isosurfaces and surface extraction;point-based visualization;star coordinates;visualization in astrophysics;particle simulations.","Data mining;Data visualization;Hydrodynamics;Computational modeling;Astrophysics;Interpolation;Sampling methods;Space exploration;Clustering methods;Level set","astronomy computing;data visualisation;feature extraction;pattern clustering;rendering (computer graphics)","surface extraction;multifield particle volume data visualization;multidimensional cluster visualization;astrophysical simulation;multivariate function;surface segmentation;multidimensional feature space exploration;automated multidimensional hierarchical clustering method;3D star coordinate layout;smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulation;point-based rendering;scientific visualization;information visualization;object-space operation","","26","","49","","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Contemporary fast intersection algorithms, which use SIMD instructions, focus on the intersection of ray packets against triangles. For intersection between single rays and triangles, operations such as horizontal addition or dot product are required. The SSE4 instruction set adds the dot product instruction which can be used for this purpose. This paper presents a new modification of the fast ray-triangle intersection algorithms commonly used, whichâwhen implemented on SSE4âoutperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms.

One active approach is projecting binary patterns in order to obtain correspondence and reconstruct a densely sampled 3D model. In such structured-light systems, determining whether a pixel is directly illuminated by the projector is essential to decoding the patterns. When a scene has abundant indirect light, this process is especially difficult. In this paper, we present a robust pixel classification algorithm for this purpose. Our method correctly establishes the lower and upper bounds of the possible intensity values of an illuminated pixel and of a non-illuminated pixel. Based on the two intervals, our method classifies a pixel by determining whether its intensity is within one interval but not in the other. Our method performs better than standard method due to the fact that it avoids gross errors during decoding process caused by strong inter-reflections. For the remaining uncertain pixels, we apply an iterative algorithm to reduce the inter-reflection within the scene. Thus, more points can be decoded and reconstructed after each iteration. Moreover, the iterative algorithm is carried out in an adaptive fashion for fast convergence.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.97","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4569840","Computer Graphics;Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism;Digitization and Image Capture;Imaging geometry;Computer Graphics;Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism;Digitization and Image Capture;Imaging geometry","Layout;Iterative decoding;Iterative algorithms;Computer graphics;Virtual reality;Application software;Robustness;Classification algorithms;Upper bound;Convergence","iterative methods;natural scenes;pattern classification","adaptive correspondence algorithm;real-world scene modeling;binary patterns;robust pixel classification;iterative algorithm","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Light;Lighting;Models, Theoretical;Reproducibility of Results;Scattering, Radiation;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface","25","6","34","IEEE","16 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resultant scatterplot, which reflects the similarities of the vectors, allows analysts to examine the graph structures and their corresponding real-life interpretations through repeated use of brushing and linking between the two visualizations. The interpretation of the graph structures is based on the outcomes of multiple participatory analysis sessions with intelligence analysts conducted by the authors at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

As a result, recent work in the visualization community has focused either on designing sequential access compression schemes or on producing cache-coherent layouts of (uncompressed) meshes for random access. Unfortunately combining these two strategies is challenging as they fundamentally assume conflicting modes of data access. In this paper, we propose a novel order-preserving compression method that supports transparent random access to compressed triangle meshes. Our decompression method selectively fetches from disk, decodes, and caches in memory requested parts of a mesh. We also provide a general mesh access API for seamless mesh traversal and incidence queries. While the method imposes no particular mesh layout, it is especially suitable for cache-oblivious layouts, which minimize the number of decompression I/O requests and provide high cache utilization during access to decompressed, in-memory portions of the mesh. Moreover, the transparency of our scheme enables improved performance without the need for application code changes. We achieve compression rates on the order of 20:1 and significantly improved I/O performance due to reduced data transfer. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we implement two common applications as benchmarks. By using cache-oblivious layouts for the input models, we observe 2-6 times overall speedup compared to using uncompressed meshes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376184","Mesh compression;random access;cache-coherent layouts;mesh data structures;external memory algorithms","Bandwidth;Data visualization;Data structures;Memory management;Delay;Space technology;Cache storage;Decoding;Computer displays;Computational modeling","application program interfaces;cache storage;computational geometry;mesh generation","cache-oblivious layout;data transfer;I/O request;API;novel order-preserving compression method;cache-coherent layout;sequential access compression scheme;disk storage;multilevel cache;random-accessible compressed triangle mesh","","25","1","44","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An attention feature aggregation (AFA) module is also introduced to adaptively select informative features from different abstraction levels, leading to segmentation with both semantic consistency and high accuracy of details.

Not only Bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain. However, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools. Previous methods of visualizing Bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods. In this paper, we present <italic>BitExTract</italic>, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of Bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client. In particular, <italic>BitExTract</italic> summarizes the evolution of the Bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view. A node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution. Moreover, <italic>BitExTract</italic> embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges. Three case studies with novel insights demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864814","RGC GRF(grant numbers:16208514); NFSC(grant numbers:61572488,61673241); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440044","Bitcoin exchange;transaction data;comparative analysis;visual analytics;FinTech","Bitcoin;Data visualization;Visualization;Task analysis;Tools","competitive intelligence;data analysis;data visualisation;electronic money;financial data processing;transaction processing","interactive visual analytics system;evolutionary transaction patterns;exchange versus exchange;exchange versus client;Bitcoin market;interactive visualization;bitcoin exchange intelligence;cryptocurrency exchanges;Bitcoin practitioners;multiple exchanges exploration;Bitcoin data visualization;financial domains;business intelligence;BitExTract;massive sequence view;node-link diagram;ego-centered views","","24","","50","IEEE","19 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We adopt the concept of the super graph to maintain spatiotemporal coherence and further balance the needs for aesthetic quality and dynamic stability when interacting with time-varying graphs through focus+context visualization. Our method is particularly useful for multifocus+context visualization of time-varying graphs where we can preserve the mental map by preventing nodes in the focus from undergoing abrupt changes in size and location in the time sequence.

We begin by reviewing the results of our initial study in this series, which were presented at the 2003 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization, and offer an expanded analysis of those findings. We continue by presenting the results of a follow-on study in which we sought to more specifically investigate the separate and combined influences on shape perception of particular texture components, with the goal of obtaining a clearer view of their potential information carrying capacities. In each study, we investigated the observers' ability to identify the intrinsic shape category of a surface patch (elliptical, hyperbolic, cylindrical, or flat) and its extrinsic surface orientation (convex, concave, both, or neither). In our first study, we compared performance under eight different texture type conditions, plus two projection conditions (perspective or orthographic) and two viewing conditions (head-on or oblique). We found that: 1) shape perception was better facilitated, in general, by the bidirectional ""principal direction grid"" pattern than by any of the seven other patterns tested; 2) shape type classification accuracy remained high under the orthographic projection condition for some texture types when the viewpoint was oblique; 3) perspective projection was required for accurate surface orientation classification; and 4) shape classification accuracy was higher when the surface patches were oriented at a (generic) oblique angle to the line of sight than when they were oriented (in a nongeneric pose) to face the viewpoint straight on. In our second study, we compared performance under eight new texture type conditions, redesigned to facilitate gathering insight into the cumulative effects of specific individual directional components in a wider variety of multidirectional texture patterns. We found that shape classification accuracy was equivalently good under a variety of test patterns that included components following either the first or first and second principal directions, in addition to other directions, suggesting that a principal direction grid texture is not the only possible ""best option"" for enhancing shape representation.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2004.5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1298804","Three-dimensional graphics and realism;vision and scene understanding;shape perception;shape representation;texture;principal directions.","Surface texture;Shape control;Data visualization;Testing;Computer graphics;Computer displays;Information analysis;Layout;Computer vision;Material properties","image texture;surface fitting;data visualisation;pattern classification;image representation;computer vision","image texture;shape categorization judgments;data visualization;surface orientation;bidirectional principal direction grid pattern;shape type classification accuracy;three-dimensional graphics;shape perception;shape representation","Decision Making;Form Perception;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Visual;Task Performance and Analysis","24","","19","","18 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A drawback of this layout is its visual clutter for multichannel EEG. To reduce clutter, we define a functional unit (FU) as a data-driven region of interest (ROI). An FU is a spatially connected set of electrodes recording pairwise significantly coherent signals, represented in the coherence graph by a spatially connected clique. Earlier we presented two methods to detect FUs, a maximal clique based (MCB) method and a more efficient watershed based (WB) method. To reduce the potential over-segmentation of the WB method, we introduce here an improved watershed based (IWB) method. The WB and IWB method both are up to a factor of 100,000 faster than the MCB method for a typical multichannel setting with 128 EEG channels, thus making interactive visualization of multichannel EEG coherence possible. We also introduce here two novel group maps for data-driven group analysis as extensions of the IWB method.

Additionally, those parts that do not contain hierarchy are drawn at the same quality expected from a nonhierarchical, undirected layout algorithm. Our experiments show that this new approach is better able to convey the structure of large digraphs than the most widely used hierarchical graph-drawing method.

However, simulation-based investigation of actions that can be taken in case of flood emergencies is rarely done. This is in part due to the lack of a comprehensive framework which integrates and facilitates these efforts. In this paper, we tackle several problems which are related to steering a flood simulation. One issue is related to uncertainty. We need to account for uncertain knowledge about the environment, such as levee-breach locations. Furthermore, the steering process has to reveal how these uncertainties in the boundary conditions affect the confidence in the simulation outcome. Another important problem is that the simulation setup is often hidden in a black-box. We expose system internals and show that simulation steering can be comprehensible at the same time. This is important because the domain expert needs to be able to modify the simulation setup in order to include local knowledge and experience. In the proposed solution, users steer parameter studies through the World Lines interface to account for input uncertainties. The transport of steering information to the underlying data-flow components is handled by a novel meta-flow. The meta-flow is an extension to a standard data-flow network, comprising additional nodes and ropes to abstract parameter control. The meta-flow has a visual representation to inform the user about which control operations happen. Finally, we present the idea to use the data-flow diagram itself for visualizing steering information and simulation results. We discuss a case-study in collaboration with a domain expert who proposes different actions to protect a virtual city from imminent flooding. The key to choosing the best response strategy is the ability to compare different regions of the parameter space while retaining an understanding of what is happening inside the data-flow system.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064950","Emergency/Disaster Management;Visual Knowledge Discovery;Visualization System and Toolkit Design;Data-Flow;Meta-Flow;Parameter Study;Uncertainty;Visualization of Control.","Data visualization;Navigation;Disaster management;Control systems;Emergency services;Data visualization","data flow computing;data mining;data visualisation;digital simulation;disasters;emergency services;floods;risk management","steering ensemble simulation;flood disaster management;natural risk;flood emergency response strategy;flood simulation;boundary conditions;World Lines interface;steering information transmission;data flow components;meta flow;standard data flow network;abstract parameter control;visual representation;data flow diagram;steering information visualization;virtual city;visual knowledge discovery","","24","1","48","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Condensation is found in many physical phenomena, e.g. the formation of atmospheric clouds or the processes inside steam turbines, where a detailed knowledge of the dynamics of condensation processes will help to optimize energy efficiency and avoid problems with droplets of macroscopic size. The key properties of these processes are the nucleation rate and the critical cluster size. For the calculation of these properties it is essential to make use of a meaningful definition of molecular clusters, which currently is a not completely resolved issue. In this paper a framework capable of interactively visualizing molecular datasets of such nucleation simulations is presented, with an emphasis on the detected molecular clusters. To check the quality of the results of the cluster detection, our framework introduces the concept of flow groups to highlight potential cluster evolution over time which is not detected by the employed algorithm. To confirm the findings of the visual analysis, we coupled the rendering view with a schematic view of the clusters' evolution. This allows to rapidly assess the quality of the molecular cluster detection algorithm and to identify locations in the simulation data in space as well as in time where the cluster detection fails. Thus, thermodynamics researchers can eliminate weaknesses in their cluster detection algorithms. Several examples for the effective and efficient usage of our tool are presented.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376195","Cluster detection analysis;molecular dynamics visualization;time-dependent scattered data;glyph visualization;out-of-core techniques;evolution graph view","Thermodynamics;Turbines;Interactive systems;Clouds;Energy efficiency;Detection algorithms;Data visualization;Metastasis;Energy resolution;Clustering algorithms","molecular dynamics method;nucleation","visual verification;molecular thermodynamics;vapor-liquid condensation;steam turbines;condensation processes;energy efficiency;molecular datasets;nucleation simulations;potential cluster evolution;molecular cluster detection algorithm","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Chemical;Models, Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Surface Properties","24","","39","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We created two sets of four environments each, plus a virtual replica of the physical environment as a baseline. The first focused on aesthetic discrepancies, such as a water surface in place of solid ground. The second focused on mixing immaterial objects together with those paired to tangible objects. For example, barring an area with walls or obstacles. We designed a study where participants had to reach three waypoints laid out in such a way to prompt a decision on which path to follow based on the conflict between the mismatching visual stimuli and their awareness of the real layout of the room. We analysed their performances to determine whether their trajectories were altered significantly from the shortest route. Our results indicate that participants altered their trajectories in presence of surfaces representing higher walking difficulty (for example, water instead of grass). However, when the graphical appearance was found to be ambiguous, there was no significant trajectory alteration. The environments mixing immaterial with physical objects had the most impact on trajectories with a mean deviation from the shortest route of 60 cm against the 37 cm of environments with aesthetic alterations. The co-existance of paired and unpaired virtual objects was reported to support the idea that all objects participants saw were backed by physical props. From these results and our observations, we derive guidelines on how to alter user movement behaviour in Virtual Environments.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2657038","Research Accelerator Fund of the University of Portsmouth; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835276","Virtual reality;Locomotion;User behaviour","Legged locomotion;Trajectory;Virtual environments;Visualization;Navigation;Tracking","user interfaces;virtual reality","user movement behaviour;virtual environments;immersive virtual reality systems;virtual replica;physical environment;aesthetic discrepancies;visual stimuli","","23","","52","CCBY","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The existing evaluations of designs that facilitate these comparisons tend to be based on intuitive reasoning, rather than quantifiable measures. We build on this work with a series of crowdsourced experiments that use low-level perceptual comparison tasks that arise frequently in comparisons within data visualizations (e.g., which value changes the most between the two sets of data?). Participants completed these tasks across a variety of layouts: overlaid, two arrangements of juxtaposed small multiples, mirror-symmetric small multiples, and animated transitions. A staircase procedure sought the difficulty level (e.g., value change delta) that led to equivalent accuracy for each layout. Confirming prior intuition, we observe high levels of performance for overlaid versus standard small multiples. However, we also find performance improvements for both mirror symmetric small multiples and animated transitions. While some results are incongruent with common wisdom in data visualization, they align with previous work in perceptual psychology, and thus have potentially strong implications for visual comparison designs.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864884","Intramural Research Program of the National Human Genome Research Institute; National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440856","Graphical perception;visual perception;visual comparison;crowdsourced evaluation","Task analysis;Visualization;Data visualization;Correlation;Bars;Layout;Mirrors","computer animation;crowdsourcing;data visualisation;psychology;visual perception","data visualization;visual comparison designs;intuitive reasoning;crowdsourced experiments;juxtaposed small multiples;animated transitions;staircase procedure;perceptual psychology;low-level perceptual comparison tasks;mirror-symmetric small multiples;overlaid layout","","23","","70","IEEE","20 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While traditional methods rely on ultimate images for quality measurement, we introduce the LOD map - an alternative representation of LOD quality and a visual interface for navigating multiresolution data exploration. Our measure for LOD quality is based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. The measure takes into account the distortion and contribution of multiresolution data blocks. A LOD map is generated through the mapping of key LOD ingredients to a treemap representation. The ordered treemap layout is used for relative stable update of the LOD map when the view or LOD changes. This visual interface not only indicates the quality of LODs in an intuitive way, but also provides immediate suggestions for possible LOD improvement through visually-striking features. It also allows us to compare different views and perform rendering budget control. A set of interactive techniques is proposed to make the LOD adjustment a simple and easy task.

The combination of both these components into telepresence systems, however, comes with significant technical challenges. All approaches proposed so far are extremely demanding on input and output devices, compute resources and transmission bandwidth, and they do not reach the level of immediacy required for applications such as remote collaboration. Here, we introduce what we believe is the first practical client-server system for real-time capture and many-user exploration of static 3D scenes. Our system is based on the observation that interactive frame rates are sufficient for capturing and reconstruction, and real-time performance is only required on the client site to achieve lag-free view updates when rendering the 3D model. Starting from this insight, we extend previous voxel block hashing frameworks by introducing a novel thread-safe GPU hash map data structure that is robust under massively concurrent retrieval, insertion and removal of entries on a thread level. We further propose a novel transmission scheme for volume data that is specifically targeted to Marching Cubes geometry reconstruction and enables a 90% reduction in bandwidth between server and exploration clients. The resulting system poses very moderate requirements on network bandwidth, latency and client-side computation, which enables it to rely entirely on consumer-grade hardware, including mobile devices. We demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art representation accuracy while providing, for any number of clients, an immersive and fluid lag-free viewing experience even during network outages.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2899231","DFG projects KL(grant numbers:KL 1142/11-1,KL 1142/9-2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8643537","Remote collaboration;live telepresence;real-time reconstruction;voxel hashing;RGB-D;real-time streaming","Three-dimensional displays;Real-time systems;Telepresence;Collaboration;Bandwidth;Servers;Hardware","augmented reality;client-server systems;data structures;graphics processing units;image reconstruction;multi-threading;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling;telecontrol","network bandwidth;client-side computation;immersive lag-free viewing experience;fluid lag-free viewing experience;real-time 3D reconstruction;immersive multiclient live telepresence;real-time 3D scene reconstruction;RGB-D sensor data;VR/AR settings;telepresence systems;transmission bandwidth;remote collaboration;real-time capture;many-user exploration;static 3D scenes;interactive frame rates;lag-free view updates;thread level;transmission scheme;client-server system;marching cubes geometry reconstruction;thread-safe GPU hash map data structure;SLAMCast;rendering;3D model;voxel block hashing framework","Computer Communication Networks;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Videoconferencing","23","","53","IEEE","17 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, on the basis of the supergraph, we therefore group nodes and edges according to their associated attributes that are changing over time. Second, the supergraph is visualized to provide an overview of the groups of nodes and edges with similar behavior over time in terms of their associated attributes.

This form of data captures information about the progression of events for an individual entity (e.g., a computer network device; a patient; an author) in the form of a series of time-stamped observations. Moreover, each event is associated with an event type (e.g., a computer login attempt, or a hospital discharge). Analyses of event sequence data have been shown to help reveal important temporal patterns, such as clinical paths resulting in improved outcomes, or an understanding of common career trajectories for scholars. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated a variety of techniques designed to overcome methodological challenges such as large volumes of data and high dimensionality. However, the effective identification and analysis of latent stages of progression, which can allow for variation within different but similarly evolving event sequences, remain a significant challenge with important real-world motivations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised stage analysis algorithm to identify semantically meaningful progression stages as well as the critical events which help define those stages. The algorithm follows three key steps: (1) event representation estimation, (2) event sequence warping and alignment, and (3) sequence segmentation. We also present a novel visualization system, ET<sup>2</sup>, which interactively illustrates the results of the stage analysis algorithm to help reveal evolution patterns across stages.

Radial drawings also allow a more flexible edge routing than horizontal drawings, as edges can be routed around the center in two directions. In experimental results, this reduces the number of crossings by approximately 30 percent on average. Few crossings are one of the major criteria for human readability.

These are good reasons to want instead to capture several smaller sub-scenes that can be joined to make the whole scene. Achieving this has traditionally been difficult: joining sub-scenes that may never have been viewed from the same angle requires a high-quality camera relocaliser that can cope with novel poses, and tracking drift in each sub-scene can prevent them from being joined to make a consistent overall scene. Recent advances, however, have significantly improved our ability to capture medium-sized sub-scenes with little to no tracking drift: real-time globally consistent reconstruction systems can close loops and re-integrate the scene surface on the fly, whilst new visual-inertial odometry approaches can significantly reduce tracking drift during live reconstruction. Moreover, high-quality regression forest-based relocalisers have recently been made more practical by the introduction of a method to allow them to be trained and used online. In this paper, we leverage these advances to present what to our knowledge is the first system to allow multiple users to collaborate interactively to reconstruct dense, voxel-based models of whole buildings using only consumer-grade hardware, a task that has traditionally been both time-consuming and dependent on the availability of specialised hardware.

However, Morse decomposition is not unique, and its granularity directly impacts its computational cost. In this paper, we propose an automatic refinement scheme to construct the Morse Connection Graph (MCG) of a given vector field in a hierarchical fashion. Our framework allows a Morse set to be refined through a local update of the flow combinatorialization graph, as well as the connection regions between Morse sets. The computation is fast because the most expensive computation is concentrated on a small portion of the domain. Furthermore, the present work allows the generation of a topologically consistent hierarchy of MCGs, which cannot be obtained using a global method. The classification of the extracted Morse sets is a crucial step for the construction of the MCG, for which the PoincarÃ© index is inadequate. We make use of an upper bound for the Conley index, provided by the Betti numbers of an index pair for a translation along the flow, to classify the Morse sets. This upper bound is sufficiently accurate for Morse set classification and provides supportive information for the automatic refinement process. An improved visualization technique for MCG is developed to incorporate the Conley indices. Finally, we apply the proposed techniques to a number of synthetic and real-world simulation data to demonstrate their utility.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928334","Morse decomposition;vector field topology;upper bound of Conley index;topology refinement;hierarchical refinement.","Indexes;Topology;Orbits;Approximation methods;Upper bound;Trajectory;Electrocardiography","data visualisation;graph theory;mathematics computing;numerical stability;pattern classification;set theory;topology;vectors","Morse set classification;hierarchical refinement;Conley index;Morse decomposition;vector field;numerically stable topological representation;Morse connection graph;flow combinatorialization graph;Poincare index;Betti numbers;visualization technique;synthetic data;real-world simulation data","","22","","40","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The true value of computation to close reading is still very much an open question. During a two-year design study, we explored this question with several poetry scholars, focusing on an investigation of sound and linguistic devices in poetry. The contributions of our design study include a problem characterization and data abstraction of the use of sound in poetry as well as Poemage, a visualization tool for interactively exploring the sonic topology of a poem. The design of Poemage is grounded in the evaluation of a series of technology probes we deployed to our poetry collaborators, and we validate the final design with several case studies that illustrate the disruptive impact technology can have on poetry scholarship.

Singularities and separatrices are extracted to decompose the flow field into topological regions. In each region, a seeding path is selected from a set of streamlines integrated in the orthogonal flow field. The uniform sample points on this path are then used as seeds to generate streamlines in the original flow field. Additional seeds are placed where a large gap between adjacent streamlines occurs. The number of short streamlines is significantly reduced as evenly spaced long streamlines spawned along the seeding paths can fill the topological regions very well. Several metrics for evaluating streamline placement quality are discussed and applied to our method as well as some other approaches. Compared to previous work in uniform streamline placement, our method is more effective in creating evenly spaced long streamlines and preserving topological features. It has the potential to provide both intuitive perception of important flow characteristics and detail reconstruction across visually pleasing streamlines.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332228","Evenly spaced streamlines;flow topology;flow visualization;seeding strategy;streamline placement.","Topology;Streaming media;Image reconstruction;Iterative algorithms;Visualization;Interpolation;Costs;Design methodology;Robustness;Layout","computer graphics;flow visualisation","seeding path;orthogonal flow field;topology-aware evenly spaced streamline placement algorithm;flow visualization","","22","","20","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, technology for the transmission of 3D moving pictures in real-time is yet to be achieved. In this paper, we present a novel method for 360-degrees viewable 3D displays and the Transpost system in which we implement the method. The basic concept of our system is to project multiple images of the object, taken from different angles, onto a spinning screen. The key to the method is projection of the images onto a directionally reflective screen with a limited viewing angle. The images are reconstructed to give the viewer a three-dimensional image of the object displayed on the screen. The display system can present images of computer-graphics pictures, live pictures, and movies. Furthermore, the reverse optical process of that in the display system can be used to record images of the subject from multiple directions. The images can then be transmitted to the display in real-time. We have developed prototypes of a 3D display and a 3D human-image transmission system. Our preliminary working prototypes demonstrate new possibilities of expression and forms of communication.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580452","Interaction styles;three-dimensional displays;stereoscopic.","Three dimensional displays;Solids;Computer displays;Motion pictures;Spinning;Image reconstruction;Prototypes;Layout;Laser modes;Data visualization","three-dimensional displays;solid modelling;image reconstruction","3D solid image;three-dimensional display;3D moving picture;360-degrees viewable 3D display;Transpost;transpost system;computer-graphics picture;3D human-image transmission system","Computer Graphics;Computer Terminals;Data Display;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pilot Projects;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","22","7","19","","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Improvements to these pipeline techniques, especially for orthogonal-style layout, are difficult and practical results have been slight in recent years. Yet, as discussed in this paper, there remain significant issues in the quality of the layouts produced by these techniques, even for quite small networks. This is especially true when layout with additional grouping constraints is required. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate an ultra-compact, grid-like network layout aesthetic that is motivated by the grid arrangements that are used almost universally by designers in typographical layout. Since the time when these heuristic and pipeline-based graph-layout methods were conceived, generic technologies (MIP, CP and SAT) for solving combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization problems have improved massively. The second contribution of this paper is to reassess whether these techniques can be used for high-quality layout of small graphs. While they are fast enough for graphs of up to 50 nodes we found these methods do not scale up. Our third contribution is a large-neighborhood search meta-heuristic approach that is scalable to larger networks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467251","Australian Research Council through Discovery Project(grant numbers:DP140100077); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192733","Network visualization;graph drawing;power graph;optimization;large-neighborhood search;Network visualization;graph drawing;power graph;optimization;large-neighborhood search","Layout;Encoding;Optimization;Containers;Standards;Routing;Pipelines","complex networks;computability;graph theory;integer programming;large-scale systems;search problems","high-quality ultra-compact grid layout;grouped networks;fast heuristic techniques;complex multistage pipelines;small graphs;pipeline techniques;orthogonal-style layout;small networks;grouping constraints;ultra-compact grid-like network layout aesthetic;grid arrangements;typographical layout;heuristic-based graph-layout methods;pipeline-based graph-layout methods;MIP;CP;SAT;combinatorial problems;mixed-integer optimization problems;large-neighborhood search meta-heuristic approach","","21","","50","IEEE","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This understanding enables us to develop an effective method for paneling freeform architectural surfaces with PH meshes. Our method first constructs an ideal triangulation of a given smooth surface, guided by surface geometry. We show that such an ideal triangulation leads to a Dupin-regular PH mesh via tangent duality on the surface.

Efficient rotation of the light representation in SPCBFs is achieved by rotating the domain of SPCBFs.

SuperMatching is formulated using a supersymmetric tensor representing an affinity metric that takes into account feature similarity and geometric constraints between features: Feature matching is cast as a higher order graph matching problem. SuperMatching takes advantage of supersymmetry to devise an efficient sampling strategy to estimate the affinity tensor, as well as to store the estimated tensor compactly. Matching is performed by an efficient higher order power iteration approach that takes advantage of this compact representation. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that SuperMatching provides more accurate feature matching than other state-of-the-art approaches for a wide range of 2D and 3D features, with competitive computational cost.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461881","Feature matching;geometric constraints;supersymmetric tensor","Tensile stress;Vectors;Shape;Transmission line matrix methods;Educational institutions;Accuracy;Computational efficiency","feature extraction;geometry;graph theory;image matching;tensors","SuperMatching algorithm;feature matching;supersymmetric geometric constraints;computer graphics;computer vision applications;pointwise approach;pairwise approach;supersymmetric tensor;affinity metric;feature similarity;higher order graph matching problem;sampling strategy;affinity tensor estimation;higher order power iteration approach;2D features;3D features","","21","","43","","14 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the fusion of multi-view features based on max or average pooling lacks a view selection mechanism, limiting its application in, e.g., multi-view active object recognition by a robot. This paper presents VERAM, a view-enhanced recurrent attention model capable of actively selecting a sequence of views for highly accurate 3D shape classification. VERAM addresses an important issue commonly found in existing attention-based models, i.e., the unbalanced training of the subnetworks corresponding to next view estimation and shape classification. The classification subnetwork is easily overfitted while the view estimation one is usually poorly trained, leading to a suboptimal classification performance. This is surmounted by three essential view-enhancement strategies: 1) enhancing the information flow of gradient backpropagation for the view estimation subnetwork, 2) devising a highly informative reward function for the reinforcement training of view estimation and 3) formulating a novel loss function that explicitly circumvents view duplication. Taking grayscale image as input and AlexNet as CNN architecture, VERAM with 9 views achieves instance-level and class-level accuracy of 95.5 and 95.3 percent on ModelNet10, 93.7 and 92.1 percent on ModelNet40, both are the state-of-the-art performance under the same number of views.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2866793","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61373135,61672299,61702281,61532003,61572507,61622212); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:1701046A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8444765","3D shape classification;multi-view 3D shape recognition;visual attention model;recurrent neural network;reinforcement learning;convolutional neural network","Three-dimensional displays;Image recognition;Solid modeling;Reinforcement learning;Recurrent neural networks;Convolutional neural networks;Computational modeling","backpropagation;convolutional neural nets;image classification;image colour analysis;neural net architecture;recurrent neural nets;shape recognition;stereo image processing","view estimation subnetwork;VERAM;view-enhanced recurrent attention model;view selection;attention-based models;3D shape classification;multiview deep neural network;multiview feature fusion;information flow;gradient backpropagation;grayscale image;AlexNet;CNN architecture;reinforcement training","","21","","50","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A cloud computing system is often comprised of a large number of parallel computing and storage devices. Monitoring the usage and performance of such a system is important for efficient operations, maintenance, and security. Tracing every application on a large cloud system is untenable due to scale and privacy issues. But profile data can be collected relatively efficiently by regularly sampling the state of the system, including properties such as CPU load, memory usage, network usage, and others, creating a set of multivariate time series for each system. Adequate tools for studying such large-scale, multidimensional data are lacking. In this paper, we present a visual based analysis approach to understanding and analyzing the performance and behavior of cloud computing systems. Our design is based on similarity measures and a layout method to portray the behavior of each compute node over time. When visualizing a large number of behavioral lines together, distinct patterns often appear suggesting particular types of performance bottleneck. The resulting system provides multiple linked views, which allow the user to interactively explore the data by examining the data or a selected subset at different levels of detail. Our case studies, which use datasets collected from two different cloud systems, show that this visual based approach is effective in identifying trends and anomalies of the systems.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2534558","US National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1320229); US Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-SC0007443,DE-SC0012610); National 973 Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB352503); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61232012,61422211); Key Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LZ12F02002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422127","Cloud computing;multidimensional data;performance visualization;visual analytics;Cloud computing;multidimensional data;performance visualization;visual analytics","Cloud computing;Data visualization;Visualization;Layout;Measurement;Monitoring;Time series analysis","Big Data;cloud computing;parallel processing","cloud computing performance;behavioral lines;Big Data analytics;parallel computing;storage devices;privacy issues;visual based analysis approach","","21","1","33","IEEE","29 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These are called stereoscopic HTDs (head-tracked displays). Stereoscopic displays render two perspective views of a scene, each of which is seen by one eye of the user. Ideally, the user's natural visual system combines the stereo image pair into a single, 3D perceived image. Unfortunately, users often have difficulty fusing the stereo image pair. Researchers use a number of software techniques to reduce fusion problems. This paper geometrically examines and compares a number of these techniques and reaches the following conclusions: In interactive stereoscopic applications, the combination of view placement, scale, and either false eye separation or /spl alpha/-false eye separation can provide fusion control that is geometrically similar to image shifting and image scaling. However, in stereo HTDs, image shifting and image scaling also generate additional geometric artifacts that are not generated by the other methods. We anecdotally link some of these artifacts to exceeding the perceptual limitations of human vision. While formal perceptual studies are still needed, geometric analysis suggests that image shifting and image scaling may be less appropriate than the other methods for interactive, stereo HTDs.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.998666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998666","","Displays;Fusion power generation;Virtual reality;Head;Rendering (computer graphics);Layout;Visual system;Application software;Image generation;Humans","tracking;computer displays;computational geometry;sensor fusion;virtual reality;three-dimensional displays;visual perception;human factors;scaling phenomena;rendering (computer graphics)","fusion control algorithms;geometric comparison;stereoscopic head-tracked displays;virtual reality;stationary display;perspective view rendering;stereo image pair fusion;3D perceived image;software techniques;interactive applications;view placement;scale;false eye separation;image shifting;image scaling;geometric artifacts;human visual perception limitations;display distortion","","20","1","43","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to overcome these problems, we introduce an infrastructure for supporting the development of specific AR interaction techniques and their adaptation to individual user needs. Our approach is threefold: a flexible AR framework providing independence from particular input devices and rendering platforms, an interaction prototyping mechanism allowing for fast prototyping of new interaction techniques, and a high-level user interface description, extending user interface descriptions into the domain of AR.

Consequently, our model can predict the degree of motion sickness more precisely than the previous method, and the results have a more similar correlation to the distribution of ground-truth sickness.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2899186","National Research Foundation of Korea; MSIT(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1A2B4005469,IITP-2018-0-01419); IITP; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8642906","360Â° Stereoscopic video;motion sickness;virtual reality;saliency;machine learning;3D CNN","Videos;Stereo image processing;Three-dimensional displays;Optical imaging;Machine learning;Optical saturation;Optical computing","convolutional neural nets;image motion analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);stereo image processing;video signal processing","motion sickness prediction;stereoscopic videos;3D convolutional neural networks;three-dimensional convolutional neural network-based method;eye movement;motion velocity;depth features;3D CNN;machine-learning model;optical flow;disparity maps","","20","","57","IEEE","15 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The space-filling curve is oriented such that the first point in each triangle is a vertex shared with the previous triangle and the last point is a vertex shared with the next triangle. Furthermore, our index can be refined locally and, therefore, efficiently when the TIN is augmented by filling any face with another TIN (to make a hierarchical TIN).

As the number of concurrent users increases, scalability becomes one of the major challenges in designing an interactive DVE system. One solution to address this scalability problem is to adopt a multi-server architecture. While some methods focus on the quality of partitioning the load among the servers, others focus on the efficiency of the partitioning process itself. However, all these methods neglect the effect of network delay among the servers on the accuracy of the load balancing solutions. As we show in this paper, the change in the load of the servers due to network delay would affect the performance of the load balancing algorithm. In this work, we conduct a formal analysis of this problem and discuss two efficient delay adjustment schemes to address the problem. Our experimental results show that our proposed schemes can significantly improve the performance of the load balancing algorithm with neglectable computation overhead.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165133","Multi-server architecture;dynamic load balancing;delay adjustment;distributed virtual environments.","Servers;Silicon;Load management;Delay;Heating;Heuristic algorithms;Load modeling","formal specification;formal verification;resource allocation;virtual reality","distributed virtual environment;massive multiplayer online game;interactive DVE system;multiserver architecture;load partitioning;network delay effect;server load;formal analysis;delay adjustment schemes;dynamic load balancing algorithm","Computer Communication Networks;Computer Graphics;Humans;Online Systems;User-Computer Interface;Video Games","20","","25","","9 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results provide insights into probability distributions for the entire network-not only for individual nodes and edges. We validate our approach using three data sets that represent a wide range of network types: synthetic data, protein-protein interactions from the STRING database, and travel times extracted from Google Maps.

Using a translating spherical eye, properly set planes of scanning, and unique parallel-central projection, we explore the image acquisition of the scene tunnel from camera selection and alignment, slit calculation, scene scanning, to image integration. The scene tunnels cover high buildings, ground, and various viewing directions and have uniformed resolutions along the street. The sequentially organized scene tunnel benefits texture mapping onto the urban models. We analyze the shape characteristics in the scene tunnels for designing visualization algorithms. After combining this with a global panorama and forward image caps, the capped scene tunnels can provide continuous views directly for virtual or real navigation in a city. We render scene tunnel dynamically by view warping, fast transmission, and flexible interaction. The compact and continuous scene tunnel facilitates model construction, data streaming, and seamless route traversing on the Internet and mobile devices.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1580450","Digitizing and scanning;image-based modeling and rendering;imaging geometry;augmented and virtual reality;Web-based interaction.","Layout;Cities and towns;Cameras;Visualization;Internet;Algorithm design and analysis;Vehicles;Buildings;Urban planning;Shape","virtual reality;data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics);image representation;image texture;realistic images;Internet","virtual reality;visual representation;scene tunnel;data visualisation;Internet;fish-eye camera;parallel-central projection;image acquisition;scene scanning;texture mapping;route traversing","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cities;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photogrammetry;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Travel;User-Computer Interface","20","6","24","IEEE","23 Jan 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A common frame defines each view, which varies based upon values of a conditioning variable. An increasingly popular use of this technique is to project two-dimensional locations into a gridded space (e.g. grid maps), using the underlying distribution both as the conditioning variable and to determine the grid layout. Using whitespace in this layout has the potential to carry information, especially in a geographic context. Yet, the effects of doing so on the spatial properties of the original units are not understood. We explore the design space offered by such small multiples with gaps. We do so by constructing a comprehensive suite of metrics that capture properties of the layout used to arrange the small multiples for comparison (e.g. compactness and alignment) and the preservation of the original data (e.g. distance, topology and shape). We study these metrics in geographic data sets with varying properties and numbers of gaps. We use simulated annealing to optimize for each metric and measure the effects on the others. To explore these effects systematically, we take a new approach, developing a system to visualize this design space using a set of interactive matrices. We find that adding small amounts of whitespace to small multiple arrays improves some of the characteristics of 2D layouts, such as shape, distance and direction. This comes at the cost of other metrics, such as the retention of topology. Effects vary according to the input maps, with degree of variation in size of input regions found to be a factor. Optima exist for particular metrics in many cases, but at different amounts of whitespace for different maps. We suggest multiple metrics be used in optimized layouts, finding topology to be a primary factor in existing manually-crafted solutions, followed by a trade-off between shape and displacement. But the rich range of possible optimized layouts leads us to challenge single-solution thinking; we suggest to consider alternative optimized layouts for small multiples with gaps. Key to our work is the systematic, quantified and visual approach to exploring design spaces when facing a trade-off between many competing criteria-an approach likely to be of value to the analysis of other design spaces.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598542","Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action(grant numbers:MSCA-H2020-IF-2014 656741); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7536128","Geographic visualization;small multiples;whitespace;design space;metrics;optimization","Measurement;Layout;Shape;Two dimensional displays;Topology;Space exploration","data visualisation;graphs;matrix algebra;set theory;simulated annealing;topology","small multiples;gaps;single data set views;common frame;view definition;two-dimensional location projection;gridded space;grid maps;layout whitespace;geographic context;metric comprehensive suite construction;data preservation;geographic data sets;simulated annealing;metric optimization;design space visualization;interactive matrix set;2D layouts;topology retention;input maps;multiple metrics;layout optimization;manually-crafted solutions","","20","","41","IEEE","8 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Findings and results of the analysis often need to be communicated to an audience that lacks visual analytics expertise. This requires analysis outcomes to be presented in simpler ways than that are typically used in visual analytics systems. However, not only analytical visualizations may be too complex for target audiences but also the information that needs to be presented. Analysis results may consist of multiple components, which may involve multiple heterogeneous facets. Hence, there exists a gap on the path from obtaining analysis findings to communicating them, within which two main challenges lie: information complexity and display complexity. We address this problem by proposing a general framework where data analysis and result presentation are linked by story synthesis, in which the analyst creates and organises story contents. Unlike previous research, where analytic findings are represented by stored display states, we treat findings as data constructs. We focus on selecting, assembling and organizing findings for further presentation rather than on tracking analysis history and enabling dual (i.e., explorative and communicative) use of data displays. In story synthesis, findings are selected, assembled, and arranged in meaningful layouts that take into account the structure of information and inherent properties of its components. We propose a workflow for applying the proposed conceptual framework in designing visual analytics systems and demonstrate the generality of the approach by applying it to two diverse domains, social media and movement analysis.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2889054","Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence; EU in projects DiSIEM and SoBigData; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602340,61572348); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0809800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585048","Story synthesis;visual analytics;social media;spatio-temporal data","Visual analytics;Rivers;Bridges;Social network services;Tools;Hospitals","computational complexity;data analysis;data visualisation;social networking (online)","social media;movement analysis;story synthesis;complex data;sophisticated algorithmic techniques;visual techniques;interactive techniques;visual analytics expertise;analysis outcomes;visual analytics systems;analytical visualizations;target audiences;multiple heterogeneous facets;analysis findings;information complexity;display complexity;data analysis;result presentation;story contents;analytic findings;data constructs;assembling organizing findings;tracking analysis history;data displays","","20","","70","IEEE","21 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The limitations observed in these approaches motivate us to collaborate with domain experts and propose a visual analytics solution for the performance analysis and incremental planning of bus routes based on an existing bus network. Developing such a solution involves three major challenges, namely, a) the in-depth analysis of complex bus route networks, b) the interactive generation of improved route candidates, and c) the effective evaluation of alternative bus routes. For challenge a, we employ an overview-to-detail approach by dividing the analysis of a complex bus network into three levels to facilitate the efficient identification of deficient routes. For challenge b, we improve a route generation model and interpret the performance of the generation with tailored visualizations. For challenge c, we incorporate a conflict resolution strategy in the progressive decision-making process to assist users in evaluating the alternative routes and finding the most optimal one.

In this paper, we present a design study in which three domain expert groups participated, an OHC researcher and two OHC administrators of online health communities, which was conducted to find with a visual analytic solution. Through our design study, we characterized the domain goals of OHC administrators and derived tasks to achieve these goals. As a result of this study, we propose a system called VisOHC, which visualizes individual OHC conversation threads as collapsed boxes-a visual metaphor of conversation threads. In addition, we augmented the posters' reply authorship network with marks and/or beams to show conversation dynamics within threads. We also developed unique measures tailored to the characteristics of OHCs, which can be encoded for thread visualizations at the users' requests. Our observation of the two administrators while using VisOHC showed that it supports their tasks and reveals interesting insights into online health communities.

We designed animated representations, based on Michotte's rules, for showing complex causal relationships or causal semantics. In this paper we describe a set of animations for showing semantics such as causal amplification, causal strength, causal dampening, and causal multiplicity. In a two part study we compared the effectiveness of both the static and animated representations. The first study (N=44) asked participants to recall passages that were previously displayed using both types of representations. Participants were 8% more accurate in recalling causal semantics when they were presented using animations instead of static graphs. In the second study (N=112) we evaluated the intuitiveness of the representations. Our results showed that while users were as accurate with the static graphs as with the animations, they were 9% faster in matching the correct causal statements in the animated condition. Overall our results show that animated diagrams that are designed based on perceptual rules such as those proposed by Michotte have the potential to facilitate comprehension of complex causal relations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376148","Causality;visualization;semantics;animated graphs;perception;visualizing cause and effect;graph semantics.","Visualization;Animation;Tires;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Humans;Iron;Fires;Motion pictures;Physics;Uncertainty","behavioural sciences computing;computer animation;data visualisation","causal semantics visualization;animation;complex causal relations;Michotte rules;causal amplification;causal strength;causal dampening;causal multiplicity;static graphs","","20","","21","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In previous studies, paper-reference matrices are usually transformed into reference-reference matrices to obtain co-citation relationships, which are then visualized in different representations, typically as node-link networks, to represent the intellectual structures of scientific domains. Such network visualizations sometimes contain tightly knit components, which make visual analysis of the intellectual structure a challenging task. In this study, we propose a new approach to reveal co-citation relationships. Instead of using a reference-reference matrix, we directly use the original paper-reference matrix as the information source, and transform the paper-reference matrix into an FP-tree and visualize it in a Java-based prototype system. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through visual analyses of the intellectual structure of two domains: information visualization and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

There are many applications of collaborative visualization, such as oceanography, meteorology and medical science. To facilitate user interaction, a critical system requirement for collaborative visualization is to ensure that remote users would perceive a synchronized view of the shared data. Failing this requirement, the user's ability in performing the desirable collaborative tasks would be affected. In this paper, we propose a synchronization method to support collaborative visualization. It considers how interaction with dynamic objects is perceived by application participants under the existence of network latency, and remedies the motion trajectory of the dynamic objects. It also handles the false positive and false negative collision detection problems.

Information from these samples is then aggregated at both the pixel and block level and used to optimize the PDFs for the next pass. Over multiple passes the PDFs and pixel estimates are updated until convergence. Using aggregation and feedback progressively improves the sampling and automatically exploits both visibility and spatial coherence. We also use novel extensions for efficient antialiasing.

The method relies on a neural network simulation of early perceptual processing in the retina and primary visual cortex. The neural activity resulting from viewing flow visualizations is simulated and evaluated to produce a metric of visualization effectiveness. Visualization optimization is achieved by applying this effectiveness metric as the utility function in a hill-climbing algorithm. We apply this method to the evaluation and optimization of 2D flow visualizations, using two visualization parameterizations: streaklet-based and pixel-based. An emergent property of the streaklet-based optimization is head-to-tail streaklet alignment. It had been previously hypothesized the effectiveness of head-to-tail alignment results from the perceptual processing of the visual system, but this theory had not been computationally modeled. A second optimization using a pixel-based parameterization resulted in a LIC-like result. The implications in terms of the selection of primitives is discussed. We argue that computational models can be used for optimizing complex visualizations. In addition, we argue that they can provide a means of computationally evaluating perceptual theories of visualization, and as a method for quality control of display methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5728805","Information visualization;perception;human information processing;neural nets;optimization.","Data visualization;Computational modeling;Visualization;Neurons;Retina;Image color analysis;Data models","biology computing;data visualisation;digital simulation;eye;neural nets;visual perception","data visualization optimization;perception computational modeling;human vision computational model;neural network simulation;retina;primary visual cortex;hill-climbing algorithm;2D flow visualizations;streaklet-based optimization;head-to-tail streaklet alignment;pixel-based parameterization;LIC-like result","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Nerve Net;Retina;Visual Cortex;Visual Perception","19","","38","IEEE","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to the CC lattices, the fD3Q13 lattice creates a more isotropic sampling of the simulation domain and its single lattice speed (i.e., link length) simplifies the computations and data storage. Furthermore, the fD3Q13 lattice can be decomposed into two independent interleaved lattices, one of which can be discarded, which doubles the simulation speed. The resulting LBM simulation can be efficiently mapped to the GPU, further increasing the computational performance. We show the numerical advantages of the FCC lattice on channeled flow in 2D and the flow-past-a-sphere benchmark in 3D. In both cases, the comparison is against the corresponding CC lattices using the analytical solutions for the systems as well as velocity field visualizations.

We focus on a personality trait known as ""locus of controlâ (LOC), which represents a person's tendency to see themselves as controlled by or in control of external events. To isolate variables of the visualization design, we control extraneous factors such as color, interaction, and labeling. We conduct a user study with four visualizations that gradually shift from a list metaphor to a containment metaphor and compare the participants' speed, accuracy, and preference with their locus of control and other personality factors. Our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between the two: participants with an internal locus of control perform more poorly with visualizations that employ a containment metaphor, while those with an external locus of control perform well with such visualizations. These results provide evidence for the externalization theory of visualization.

We take advantage of the fact that, for many types of data, independent crowd workers can readily perform basic analysis tasks like examining views and generating explanations for trends and patterns. However, workers operating in parallel can often generate redundant explanations. Moreover, because workers have different competencies and domain knowledge, some responses are likely to be more plausible than others. To efficiently utilize the crowd's work, analysts must be able to quickly identify and consolidate redundant responses and determine which explanations are the most plausible. In this paper, we demonstrate several crowd-assisted techniques to help analysts make better use of crowdsourced explanations: (1) We explore crowd-assisted strategies that utilize multiple workers to detect redundant explanations. We introduce color clustering with representative selection-a strategy in which multiple workers cluster explanations and we automatically select the most-representative result-and show that it generates clusterings that are as good as those produced by experts. (2) We capture explanation provenance by introducing highlighting tasks and capturing workers' browsing behavior via an embedded web browser, and refine that provenance information via source-review tasks. We expose this information in an explanation-management interface that allows analysts to interactively filter and sort responses, select the most plausible explanations, and decide which to explore further.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634191","Market research;Redundancy;Data analysis;Social network services;Image color analysis;Clustering algorithms;Social Data Analysis;Crowdsourcing","Market research;Redundancy;Data analysis;Social network services;Image color analysis;Clustering algorithms","data analysis;groupware;information filtering;online front-ends;pattern clustering;sorting","redundancy explanation identification;crowdsourced data analysis;explanation provenance expose;crowd-assisted techniques;crowdsourced explanations;color clustering with representative selection;workers browsing behavior;embedded Web browser;provenance information;source-review tasks;explanation-management interface;response filtering;response sorting","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Data Mining;Databases, Factual;Information Storage and Retrieval;Internet;User-Computer Interface","19","4","23","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we present a novel stackless approach for implicit kd-trees, which exploits the benefits of index-based node traversal, without incurring extra node visitation. This approach, which we term Kd-Jump, enables the traversal to immediately return to the next valid node, like a stack, without incurring extra node visitation (kd-restart). Also, Kd-Jump does not require global memory (stack) at all and only requires a small matrix in fast constant-memory. We report that Kd-Jump outperforms a stack by 10 to 20% and kd-restar t by 100%. We also present a Hybrid Kd-Jump, which utilizes a volume stepper for leaf testing and a run-time depth threshold to define where kd-tree traversal stops and volume-stepping occurs.

Encoding nodes with vectorized representations by transforming information of surrounding structures of nodes into a high dimensional space, our approach can identify similar structures within a large network, enable user interaction with multiple similar structures simultaneously, and guide the exploration of unexplored structures.

We define an expanded space of axis labelings by automatically generating additional nice numbers as needed and by permitting the extreme labels to occur inside the data range. These changes provide flexibility in problematic cases, without degrading quality elsewhere. We also propose an additional optimization criterion, legibility, which allows us to simultaneously optimize over label formatting, font size, and orientation. To solve this revised optimization problem, we describe the optimization function and an efficient search algorithm. Finally, we compare our method to previous work using both quantitative and qualitative metrics. This paper is a good example of how ideas from automated graphic design can be applied to information visualization.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613441","axis labeling;nice numbers","Labeling;Optimization;Measurement;Visualization;Search problems;Layout","data visualisation;optimisation;search problems","Wilkinson algorithm;tick label positioning;data visualization;data legend;contextual information;data interpretation;axis tick marks;Wilkinson optimization-based labeling;label formatting;font size;label orientation;optimization function;search algorithm;graphic design;information visualization","","18","","12","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As this increasing amount of available information is used to link individuals to their ancestors, the resulting trees become deeper and more dense, which justifies the need for using organized, space-efficient layouts to display the data. Existing layouts are often only able to show a small subset of the data at a time. As a result, it is easy to become lost when navigating through the data or to lose sight of the overall tree structure. On the contrary, leaving space for unknown ancestors allows one to better understand the tree's structure, but leaving this space becomes expensive and allows fewer generations to be displayed at a time. In this work, we propose that the H-tree based layout be used in genealogical software to display ancestral trees. We will show that this layout presents an increase in the number of displayable generations, provides a nicely arranged, symmetrical, intuitive and organized fractal structure, increases the user's ability to understand and navigate through the data, and accounts for the visualization requirements necessary for displaying such trees. Finally, user-study results indicate potential for user acceptance of the new layout.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613444","Genealogy;Pedigree;H-Tree","Layout;Data visualization;Binary trees;Navigation;Software;Shape;Context","data visualisation;genetics;history;tree data structures","PedVis;pedigree visualization;public genealogical database;historical data;population ancestor;space-efficient layout;data navigation;tree structure;H-tree based layout;genealogical software;ancestral tree;organized fractal structure;visualization requirement;user acceptance","","18","","35","IEEE","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

If such attributes exhibit a tree structure, visualizing a compound graph consisting of tree and network structures becomes complicated. How to visually reveal patterns of a network over a tree has not been fully studied. In this paper, we propose a compound graph model, TreeNet, to support visualization and analysis of a network at multiple levels of aggregation over a tree. We also present a visualization design, TreeNetViz, to offer the multiscale and cross-scale exploration and interaction of a TreeNet graph. TreeNetViz uses a Radial, Space-Filling (RSF) visualization to represent the tree structure, a circle layout with novel optimization to show aggregated networks derived from TreeNet, and an edge bundling technique to reduce visual complexity. Our circular layout algorithm reduces both total edge-crossings and edge length and also considers hierarchical structure constraints and edge weight in a TreeNet graph. These experiments illustrate that the algorithm can reduce visual cluttering in TreeNet graphs. Our case study also shows that TreeNetViz has the potential to support the analysis of a compound graph by revealing multiscale and cross-scale network patterns.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065012","Compound graph;network and tree;TreeNetViz;visualization;multiscale and cross-scale.","Graphics;Tree data structures;Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Data visualization","computational complexity;data visualisation;graph theory;optimisation;tree data structures","TreeNetViz;networks patterns;tree structures;network data;social network;social affiliations;expertise areas;compound graph model;TreeNet graph;radial space filling visualization;circle layout;optimization;visual complexity;visual cluttering","","18","","42","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Discovering interesting patterns through visualization is an important way of gaining insight about such data. A previously proposed approach is to apply local placement functions such as PixelMaps that transform the input data set into a solution set that preserves certain constraints while making interesting patterns more obvious and avoid data loss from overplotting. In experience, this family of spatial transformations can reveal fine structures in large point sets, but it is sometimes difficult to relate those structures to basic geographic features such as cities and regional boundaries. Recent information visualization research has addressed other types of transformation functions that make spatially-transformed maps with recognizable shapes. These types of spatial-transformation are called global shape functions. In particular, cartogram-based map distortion has been studied. On the other hand, cartogram-based distortion does not handle point sets readily. In this study, we present a framework that allows the user to specify a global shape function and a local placement function. We combine cartogram-based layout (global shape) with PixelMaps (local placement), obtaining some of the benefits of each toward improved exploration of dense geo-spatial data sets.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4015426","Geo-spatial Data;Shape Transformation;Cartogram;Pixel Placement","Shape;Data visualization;Cities and towns;Credit cards;Data analysis;Marketing and sales;Telephony;Cellular phones;Kernel;Genomics","cartography;data visualisation","geo-spatial point set visualization;shape transformation;local pixel placement;PixelMaps;information visualization;spatially-transformed maps;global shape functions;cartogram-based map distortion","","18","","12","IEEE","20 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We developed a visualization technique that supports the analysis of the topology and the hierarchical group structure of a dynamic graph and the tracking of changes over time. Each graph of a sequence is visualized by an adjacency matrix, where the hierarchical group structure is encoded within the matrix using indentation and nested contours, complemented by icicle plots attached to the matrices. The density within and between subgroups of the hierarchy is represented within the matrices using a gray scale. To visualize changes, transitions and dissimilarities between the hierarchically structured graphs are shown using a flow metaphor and color coding. The design of our visualization technique allows us to show more than one hierarchical group structure of the same graph by stacking the sequences, where hierarchy comparison is supported not only within but also between sequences. To improve the readability, we minimize the number of crossing curves within and between sequences based on a sorting algorithm that sweeps through the sequences of hierarchies.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2507595","DFG; DFG(grant numbers:WE 2836/6-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7352369","Dynamic graph;hierarchical graph;graph visualization","Visualization;Data visualization;Topology;Three-dimensional displays;Heuristic algorithms;Sorting;Animation","data visualisation;graph theory;matrix algebra;sorting","dynamic hierarchies visualization;graph sequences;dynamic graph topology;dynamic graph hierarchical group structure;adjacency matrix;nested contours;icicle plots;hierarchically structured graphs;flow metaphor;color coding;sorting algorithm","","18","","55","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Central to our experiment is a comparison between two ways to lay out ranges: a more conventional linear layout strikes a balance between quantitative and chronological scale resolution, while a less conventional radial layout emphasizes the cyclicality of time and may prioritize discrimination between values at its periphery. With results from 87 crowd workers, we found that while participants completed tasks more quickly with linear layouts than with radial ones, there were few differences in terms of error rate between layout conditions. We also found that participants performed similarly with both layouts in tasks that involved comparing superimposed observed and average ranges.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440812","Evaluation;graphical perception;mobile phones;range visualization;crowdsourcing","Data visualization;Mobile handsets;Temperature distribution;Layout;Task analysis;Encoding;Meteorology","crowdsourcing;data visualisation;Internet;mobile computing;smart phones","data characteristics;personal health apps;blood pressure readings;weather forecasting apps;crowdsourced visualization experiment;task-based crowdsourced evaluation;mobile phone;visualizing ranges;linear layouts","","18","","54","IEEE","20 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The core of the framework is a set of three interconnected graphs, each with associated operators: a scene graph for high-performance 3D rendering, a data graph for different layers of semantically-linked heterogeneous data, and a timing graph for sophisticated control of scheduling, interaction, and animation. In particular, the timing graph provides a unified system to add behaviors to both data and visual elements, as well as to the behaviors themselves. To evaluate the framework we look briefly at three different projects all of which required novel visualizations in different domains, and all of which worked with dynamic data in different ways: an interactive ecological simulation, an information art installation, and an information visualization technique.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613455","Visualization System and Toolkit Design (primary keyword);Time-varying Data;Streaming Data;Animation;Visual Design","Data visualization;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics);Timing;Data models;Animation;Programming","data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics)","dynamic data visualization;information visualization software;high-performance 3D rendering;information art","","18","","37","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Balloon Focus: a Seamless Multi-Focus+Context Method for Treemaps","Y. Tu; H. Shen",the Ohio State University; the Ohio State University,"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","24 Oct 2008","2008","14","6","1157","1164","The treemap is one of the most popular methods for visualizing hierarchical data. When a treemap contains a large number of items, inspecting or comparing a few selected items in a greater level of detail becomes very challenging. In this paper, we present a seamless multi-focus and context technique, called Balloon Focus, that allows the user to smoothly enlarge multiple treemap items served as the foci, while maintaining a stable treemap layout as the context. Our method has several desirable features. First, this method is quite general and can be used with different treemap layout algorithms. Second, as the foci are enlarged, the relative positions among all items are preserved. Third, the foci are placed in a way that the remaining space is evenly distributed back to the non-focus treemap items. When Balloon Focus enlarges the focus items to a maximum degree, the above features ensure that the treemap will maintain a consistent appearance and avoid any abrupt layout changes. In our algorithm, a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is used to maintain the positional constraints, and an elastic model is employed to govern the placement of the treemap items. We demonstrate a treemap visualization system that integrates data query, manual focus selection, and our novel multi-focus+context technique, Balloon Focus, together. A user study was conducted. Results show that with Balloon Focus, users can better perform the tasks of comparing the values and the distribution of the foci.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658125","Index Termsâ;Treemap;focus+context;multi-focus;fisheye;magnification;visualizing query results;multi-scale viewing.","Data visualization;Displays;Tree graphs;Computer science;Manuals;Large-scale systems;File systems;Telecommunication traffic;Navigation;Computer interfaces","data visualisation;directed graphs","multifocus+context method;treemaps;data visualization;balloon focus;directed acyclic graph;data query","","17","","28","","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, streamgraph as well as ThemeRiver suffer from scalability problems when dealing with several time series. To solve this problem, multiple time series can be organized into a hierarchical structure where individual time series are grouped hierarchically according to their proximity. In this paper, we present a new streamgraph-based approach to convey the hierarchical structure of multiple time series to facilitate the exploration and comparisons of temporal evolution.

Key to the simplicity and efficiency of the algorithm is an alternate definition of the Reeb graph that considers equivalence classes of level sets instead of individual level sets. The algorithm works in two steps. The first step locates all critical points of the function in the domain. Critical points correspond to nodes in the Reeb graph. Arcs connecting the nodes are computed in the second step by a simple search procedure that works on a small subset of the domain that corresponds to a pair of critical points. The paper also describes a scheme for controlled simplification of the Reeb graph and two different graph layout schemes that help in the effective presentation of Reeb graphs for visual analysis of scalar fields. Finally, the Reeb graph is employed in four different applications-surface segmentation, spatially-aware transfer function design, visualization of interval volumes, and interactive exploration of time-varying data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710907","Computational topology;scalar functions;Reeb graphs;level set topology;simplification;graph layout.","Level set;Topology;Manifolds;Layout;Algorithm design and analysis;Isosurfaces;Heuristic algorithms","computational geometry;graph theory;search problems;set theory","output sensitive Reeb graphs construction;scalar function;topology evolution;level sets;near optimal output sensitive algorithm;search procedure;visual scalar field analysis;surface segmentation;spatially aware transfer function design;interval volume visualization;interactive time varying data exploration","","17","","44","","10 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their black-box nature also makes it a challenging task to incorporate domain-specific knowledge of the experts into the model. In ProtoSteer (Prototype Steering), we tackle the challenge of directly involving the domain experts to steer a deep sequence model without relying on model developers as intermediaries. Our approach originates in case-based reasoning, which imitates the common human problem-solving process of consulting past experiences to solve new problems. We utilize ProSeNet (Prototype Sequence Network), which learns a small set of exemplar cases (i.e., prototypes) from historical data. In ProtoSteer they serve both as an efficient visual summary of the original data and explanations of model decisions. With ProtoSteer the domain experts can inspect, critique, and revise the prototypes interactively. The system then incorporates user-specified prototypes and incrementally updates the model. We conduct extensive case studies and expert interviews in application domains including sentiment analysis on texts and predictive diagnostics based on vehicle fault logs. The results demonstrate that involvements of domain users can help obtain more interpretable models with concise prototypes while retaining similar accuracy.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934267","Hong Kong TRS(grant numbers:T41-709/17N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827944","Sequence Data;Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI);Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs);Prototype Learning","Prototypes;Data visualization;Data models;Machine learning;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Task analysis","case-based reasoning;data analysis;data visualisation","domain-specific knowledge;ProtoSteer;deep sequence model;human problem-solving process;model decisions;user-specified prototypes;application domains;domain users;interpretable models;natural language processing;prototype steering;case-based reasoning;ProSeNet;prototype sequence network;visual summary","Computer Graphics;Deep Learning;Humans;Models, Theoretical;User-Computer Interface","17","","51","IEEE","10 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a simple registration method using projective reconstruction. This method consists of two steps: embedding and tracking. Embedding involves specifying four points to build the world coordinate system on which a virtual object will be superimposed. In tracking, a projective reconstruction technique is used to track these four specified points to compute the model view transformation for augmentation. This method is simple, as only four points need to be specified at the embedding stage and the virtual object can then be easily augmented onto a real scene from a video sequence. In addition, it can be extended to a scenario using the projective matrix that has been obtained from previous registration results using the same AR system. The proposed method has three advantages: 1) it is fast because the linear least square method can be used to estimate the related matrix in the algorithm and it is not necessary to calculate the fundamental matrix in the extended case. 2) A virtual object can still be superimposed on a related area even if some parts of the specified area are occluded during the whole process. 3) This method is robust because it remains effective even when not all the reference points are detected during the whole process, as long as at least six pairs of related reference points correspondences can be found. Some experiments have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407858","Index Terms- Augmented reality;registration;projective reconstruction;tracking.","Augmented reality;Magnetic sensors;Layout;Acoustic sensors;Cameras;Image reconstruction;Video sequences;Object detection;Application software;Computer vision","augmented reality;image registration;image reconstruction;image sequences;least squares approximations","image registration;projective reconstruction technique;augmented reality system;tracking;virtual object;model view transformation;real scene;video sequence;linear least square method;occlusion","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","17","1","25","","21 Mar 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network operators and cyber analysts need fast and scalable tools to help identify suspicious behavior that bypasses automated security systems, but operators do not want another automated tool with algorithms they do not trust. Experts need tools to augment their own domain expertise and to provide a contextual understanding of suspicious behavior to help them make decisions. In this paper we present Situ, a visual analytics system for discovering suspicious behavior in streaming network data. Situ provides a scalable solution that combines anomaly detection with information visualization. The system's visualizations enable operators to identify and investigate the most anomalous events and IP addresses, and the tool provides context to help operators understand why they are anomalous.

Unlike images, it is difficult to define spatial proximity in skeletal motions in the way that deep networks can be applied for feature extraction. Second, motion is time-series data with strong multi-modal temporal correlations between frames. On the one hand, a frame could be followed by several candidate frames leading to different motions; on the other hand, long-range dependencies exist where a number of frames in the beginning are correlated with a number of frames later. Ineffective temporal modeling would either under-estimate the multi-modality and variance, resulting in featureless mean motion or over-estimate them resulting in jittery motions, which is a major source of visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new deep network to tackle these challenges by creating a natural motion manifold that is versatile for many applications. The network has a new spatial component for feature extraction. It is also equipped with a new batch prediction model that predicts a large number of frames at once, such that long-term temporally-based objective functions can be employed to correctly learn the motion multi-modality and variances. With our system, long-duration motions can be predicted/synthesized using an open-loop setup where the motion retains the dynamics accurately. It can also be used for denoising corrupted motions and synthesizing new motions with given control signals. We demonstrate that our system can create superior results comparing to existing work in multiple applications.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2936810","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/R031193/1); Nvidia; Royal Society(grant numbers:IES\R2\181024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809754","Computer graphics;computer animation;character animation;deep learning","Manifolds;Deep learning;Skeleton;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Dynamics;Animation","computer graphics;computer vision;feature extraction;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;time series","skeletal information;feature extraction;skeletal motions;deep network;time-series data;featureless mean motion;natural motion manifold;batch prediction model;motion multimodality;spatio-temporal manifold learning;human motions;long-horizon modeling;data-driven modeling;computer graphics;computer vision;corrupted motion denoising;open-loop setup;deep learning","Computer Graphics;Deep Learning;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Movement;Video Recording","17","","53","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The visual quality of a treemap is commonly measured via the aspect ratio of the rectangles. If the data changes, then a second important quality criterion is the stability of the treemap: how much does the treemap change as the data changes. We present a novel stable treemapping algorithm that has very high visual quality. Whereas existing treemapping algorithms generally recompute the treemap every time the input changes, our algorithm changes the layout of the treemap using only local modifications. This approach not only gives us direct control over stability, but it also allows us to use a larger set of possible layouts, thus provably resulting in treemaps of higher visual quality compared to existing algorithms. We further prove that we can reach all possible treemap layouts using only our local modifications. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure for stability that better captures the relative positions of rectangles. We finally show via experiments on real-world data that our algorithm outperforms existing treemapping algorithms also in practice on either visual quality and/or stability. Our algorithm scores high on stability regardless of whether we use an existing stability measure or our new measure.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745140","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(grant numbers:639.023.208,639.021.541); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8019841","Treemap;Stability;Local Moves","Layout;Visualization;Stability criteria;Space exploration;Position measurement;Binary trees","data visualisation;tree data structures","data changes;high visual quality;local modifications;rectangles;treemap change;visual quality;stable treemapping algorithm;treemap layouts;hierarchical data visualization","","17","","20","IEEE","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Both Experiment 1 and 2 asked participants to search for a unique target in colored visualizations to test how the grouping, quantity, and size of marks affects user performance. In Experiment 1, the target square was embedded in a grid of squares and in Experiment 2 the target was a point in a scatterplot. Search performance was faster when colors were spatially grouped than when they were randomly arranged. The quantity of marks had little effect on search time for grouped displays (âpop-outâ), but increasing the quantity of marks slowed reaction time for random displays. Regardless of color layout (grouped vs. random), response times were slowest for the smallest mark size and decreased as mark size increased to a point, after which response times plateaued. In addition to these two experiments we also include potential application areas, as well as results from a small case study where we report preliminary findings that size may affect how users infer how visualizations should be used.

The thread-like structures of neurons and micro-vessels pose a unique problem in visualization since they tend to be densely packed in small volumes of tissue. This makes it difficult for an observer to interpret useful patterns from the data or trace individual fibers. In this paper we describe several methods for dealing with large amounts of thread-like data, such as data sets collected using Knife-Edge Scanning Microscopy (KESM) and Serial Block-Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF-SEM). These methods allow us to collect volumetric data from embedded samples of whole-brain tissue. The neuronal and microvascular data that we acquire consists of thin, branching structures extending over very large regions. Traditional visualization schemes are not sufficient to make sense of the large, dense, complex structures encountered. In this paper, we address three methods to allow a user to explore a fiber network effectively. We describe interactive techniques for rendering large sets of neurons using self-orienting surfaces implemented on the GPU. We also present techniques for rendering fiber networks in a way that provides useful information about flow and orientation. Third, a global illumination framework is used to create high-quality visualizations that emphasize the underlying fiber structure.

However, most prior studies focus on using low-level visual features of images, such as texture and color histogram, to create visualizations without considering the more important semantic information embedded in images. This paper proposes a novel visual analytic system to analyze images in a semantic-aware manner. The system mainly comprises two components: a semantic information extractor and a visual layout generator. The semantic information extractor employs an image captioning technique based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to produce descriptive captions for images, which can be transformed into semantic keywords. The layout generator employs a novel co-embedding model to project images and the associated semantic keywords to the same 2D space. Inspired by the galaxy metaphor, we further turn the projected 2D space to a galaxy visualization of images, in which semantic keywords and images are visually encoded as stars and planets. Our system naturally supports multi-scale visualization and navigation, in which users can immediately see a semantic overview of an image collection and drill down for detailed inspection of a certain group of images. Users can iteratively refine the visual layout by integrating their domain knowledge into the co-embedding process. Two task-based evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2835485","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1004302); NSFC(grant numbers:61761136020,61502416); NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund(grant numbers:U1609217); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:LR18F020001); Zhejiang University; Microsoft Research Asia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8358974","Image visualization;semantic layout;CNN;image captioning","Semantics;Visualization;Data visualization;Task analysis;Image analysis;Data mining;Layout","convolutional neural nets;data analysis;data visualisation;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;semantic networks","image captioning technique;galaxy visualization;semantic overview;image collection;semantic-based method;interactive visualization;personal album management;user profiling;low-level visual features;semantic-aware manner;semantic information extractor;visual layout generator;semantic keywords;semantic information;visual analytic system;convolutional neural network;CNN;co-embedding process","","16","","54","IEEE","15 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fidelity of the environment plays an important role for allowing corresponding spatial references in remote collaboration. We present a novel asymmetric platform, Augmented Virtual Teleportation (AVT), which provides high-fidelity telepresence of a remote VR user (VR-Traveler) into a real-world collaboration space to interact with a local AR user (AR-Host). AVT uses a 360Â° video camera (360-camera) that captures and live-streams the omni-directional scenes over a network. The remote VR-Traveler watching the video in a VR headset experiences live presence and co-presence in the real-world collaboration space. The VR-Traveler's movements are captured and transmitted to a 3D avatar overlaid onto the 360-camera which can be seen in the AR-Host's display. The visual and audio cues for each collaborator are synchronized in the Mixed Reality Collaboration space (MRC-space), where they can interactively edit virtual objects and collaborate in the real environment using the real objects as a reference. High fidelity, real-time rendering of virtual objects and seamless blending into the real scene allows for unique mixed reality use-case scenarios.

They have a large number of application areas ranging from statistical data analysis to software engineering. However, the automated generation of Euler diagrams has never been easy: given an abstract description of a required Euler diagram, it is computationally expensive to generate the diagram. Moreover, the generated diagrams represent sets by polygons, sometimes with quite irregular shapes that make the diagrams less comprehensible. In this paper, we address these two issues by developing the theory of piercings, where we define single piercing curves and double piercing curves. We prove that if a diagram can be built inductively by successively adding piercing curves under certain constraints, then it can be drawn with circles, which are more esthetically pleasing than arbitrary polygons. The theory of piercings is developed at the abstract level. In addition, we present a Java implementation that, given an inductively pierced abstract description, generates an Euler diagram consisting only of circles within polynomial time.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582085","Automated diagram drawing;Euler diagrams;diagrammatic reasoning;information visualization.","Software;Polynomials;Layout;Visualization;Measurement;Ontologies;Shape","computational geometry;data visualisation;Java;polynomials","Euler diagrams;circles;piercings theory;set intersection visualization;statistical data analysis;software engineering;single piercing curves;double piercing curves;arbitrary polygons;Java implementation;polynomial time","","16","","27","IEEE","23 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a collection of streamlines or stream surfaces generated from a flow field data set, our approach converts them into binary volumes and then employs an autoencoder to learn their respective latent feature descriptors. These descriptors are used to reconstruct binary volumes for error estimation and network training. Once converged, the feature descriptors can well represent flow lines or surfaces in the latent space. We perform dimensionality reduction of these feature descriptors and cluster the projection results accordingly. This leads to a visual interface for exploring the collection of flow lines or surfaces via clustering, filtering, and selection of representatives. Intuitive user interactions are provided for visual reasoning of the collection with ease.

First, we propose a constrained random walks algorithm that can add constraints to the random walks procedure and thus allows for a variety of intuitive user inputs. Second, we design an optimization process that uses the shortest graph path to derive a nice cut contour. Then a new mesh cutting algorithm is developed based on the constrained random walks plus the optimization process. Within the same computational framework, the new algorithm provides a novel user interface for interactive mesh cutting that supports three typical user inputs and also their combinations: 1) foreground/background seed inputs: the user draws strokes specifying seeds for âforegroundâ (i.e., the part to be cut out) and âbackgroundâ (i.e., the rest); 2) soft constraint inputs: the user draws strokes on the mesh indicating the region which the cuts should be made nearby; and 3) hard constraint inputs: the marks which the cutting contour must pass. The algorithm uses feature sensitive metrics that are based on surface geometric properties and cognitive theory. The integration of the constrained random walks algorithm, the optimization process, the feature sensitive metrics, and the varieties of user inputs makes the algorithm intuitive, flexible, and effective as well. The experimental examples show that the proposed cutting method is fast, reliable, and capable of producing good results reflecting user intention and geometric attributes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453359","Computational geometry and object modeling;interaction techniques;geometric algorithms.","Shape;Humans;Constraint optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Process design;Design optimization;Computer interfaces;User interfaces;Geometry;Solid modeling","computational geometry;constraint handling;graph theory;mesh generation;optimisation","constrained random walks;optimization process;graph path;interactive mesh cutting;user interface;cognitive theory;surface geometric properties","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;User-Computer Interface","16","2","36","","22 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main contribution of our design study is a novel visual representation for tree-like, multivariate graphs, which we apply to genealogies and clinical data about the individuals in these families. We introduce data-driven aggregation methods to scale to multiple families. By designing the genealogy graph layout to align with a tabular view, we are able to incorporate extensive, multivariate attributes in the analysis of the genealogy without cluttering the graph. We validate our designs by conducting case studies with our domain collaborators.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2811488","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:U01 CA198935,R00 HG007583,R01MH099134); DoD â Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA)(grant numbers:ST1605-16-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8307265","Multivariate networks;biology visualization;genealogies;hereditary genetics;multifactorial diseases","Genetics;Diseases;Data visualization;Tools;Task analysis;Environmental factors;Sociology","biology computing;data visualisation;genetics;genomics;molecular biophysics","Lineage;multivariate clinical data;genealogy graphs;public heath;individual heath;hereditary factors;environmental factors;domain experts;multifactorial diseases;shared genomic variants;genealogical data;genetic data;multivariate graph visualization problem;genealogy graph layout;visual analysis tool;clinical data;visual representation;familial relationships","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Databases, Genetic;Disease;Female;Genealogy and Heraldry;Genomics;Humans;Male;Pedigree","16","","76","IEEE","6 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each MPI job may use different core counts or hardware configurations, allowing fine tuning of the amount of resources dedicated to each part of the workload. By making use of a distributed shared memory file, one may read data from the simulation, modify it using ParaView pipelines, write it back, to be reused by the simulation (or vice versa). This allows not only simple parameter changes, but complete remeshing of grids, or operations involving regeneration of field values over the entire domain.

This design is powerful and flexible enough to support and exploit a large body of existing illumination algorithms for the simulation of various aspects of the underlying physical model. Additionally, the Vision architecture offers a platform for developing new algorithms and for combining them to create new rendering solutions.

Even if the shapes of the small structures are evident in a 3D display, the aggregate shapes they suggest may not be easily inferred. From previous studies in shape perception, the evidence has not been clear whether physically-based illumination confers any advantage over local illumination for understanding scenes that arise in visualization of large data sets that contain features at two distinct scales. In this paper we show that physically-based illumination can improve the perception for some static scenes of complex 3D geometry from flow fields. We perform human-subjects experiments to quantify the effect of physically-based illumination on participant performance for two tasks: selecting the closer of two streamtubes from a field of tubes, and identifying the shape of the domain of a flow field over different densities of tubes. We find that physically-based illumination influences participant performance as strongly as perspective projection, suggesting that physically-based illumination is indeed a strong cue to the layout of complex scenes. We also find that increasing the density of tubes for the shape identification task improved participant performance under physically-based illumination but not under the traditional hardware-accelerated illumination model.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658196","Index Termsâ;user study;volume completion;3D shape perception;physically-based illumination;global illumination;local illumination;multi-scale visualization;flow visualization;streamtubes;DT-MRI;white matter tractography","Lighting;Three dimensional displays;Shape;Layout;Data visualization;Humans;Visual system;Psychology;Aggregates;Geometry","computer vision;data visualisation;flow visualisation","linear perspective;physically-based illumination;dense 3D streamtubes;large data sets visualization;complex 3D geometry","","15","","28","","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, finding a visual feature to enhance for the focus to pop out from its context in a large dynamic scene, while leading to minimal visual deformation and subjective disturbance, is challenging. This paper proposes Attractive Flicker, a novel technique for visual guidance in dynamic narrative visualizations. We first show that flicker is a strong visual attractor in the entire visual field, without distorting, suppressing, or adding any scene elements. The novel aspect of our Attractive Flicker technique is that it consists of two signal stages: The first âorientation stageâ is a short but intensive flicker stimulus to attract the attention to elements of interest. Subsequently, the intensive flicker is reduced to a minimally disturbing luminance oscillation (âengagement stageâ) as visual support to keep track of the focus elements. To find a good trade-off between attraction effectiveness and subjective annoyance caused by flicker, we conducted two perceptual studies to find suitable signal parameters. We showcase Attractive Flicker with the parameters obtained from the perceptual statistics in a study of molecular interactions. With Attractive Flicker, users were able to easily follow the narrative of the visualization on a large display, while the flickering of focus elements was not disturbing when observing the context.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346352","Vienna Science and Technology Fund; VRG 11Â¿010; EC Marie Curie Career Integration Grant(grant numbers:PCIGI3-GA-2013-618680); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876019","Visual attention;flicker;narrative visualization","Context awareness;Social network services;Image color analysis;Observers;Data visualization;Data models","brightness;data visualisation;human factors;visual perception","attention guidance;dynamic narrative visualizations;focus-plus-context techniques;visual guidance;visual prominence;context suppression;visual feature;large-dynamic scene;minimal visual deformation;subjective disturbance;visual attractor;visual field;Attractive Flicker technique;signal stages;orientation stage;short-intensive flicker stimulus;attention attraction;minimally-disturbing luminance oscillation;engagement stage;visual support;focus elements;attraction effectiveness;subjective annoyance;perceptual studies;signal parameters;perceptual statistics;molecular interactions","","15","","48","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Spheroidal weathering is fastest in areas with large positive mean curvature and cavernous weathering is fastest in areas with large negative mean curvature. We simulate both processes using an approximation of mean curvature on a voxel grid. Both weathering rates are also influenced by rock durability. The user controls rock durability by editing a durability graph before and during weathering simulation. Simulations of rockfall and colluvium deposition further improve realism. The profile of the final weathered rock matches the shape of the durability graph up to the effects of weathering and colluvium deposition.

This involves analyzing intersection relations between these groups, and how the element attributes vary between these intersections. This kind of set-based analysis has various applications in a variety of domains, due to the generic and powerful notion of sets. However, visualizing intersections relations is challenging because their number grows exponentially with the number of sets. We present a novel technique based on Treemaps to provide a comprehensive overview of non-empty intersections in a set system in a scalable way.

The use of proxy objects is common in software engineering for analysis and interaction with heavy objects or systems. In this paper, we coin the term 'proxy graph' and empirically investigate how well a proxy graph visualization can represent a big graph. Our investigation focuses on proxy graphs obtained by sampling; this is one of the most common proxy approaches. Despite the plethora of data sampling studies, this is the first evaluation of sampling in the context of graph visualization. For an objective evaluation, we propose a new family of quality metrics for visual quality of proxy graphs. Our experiments cover popular sampling techniques.

Our RACBVH representation is compact and transparently supports random access on the compressed BVHs without decompressing the whole BVH. To support random access on our compressed BVHs, we decompose a BVH into a set of clusters. Each cluster contains consecutive bounding volume (BV) nodes in the original layout of the BVH. Also, each cluster is compressed separately from other clusters and serves as an access point to the RACBVH representation. We provide the general BVH access API to transparently access our RACBVH representation. At runtime, our decompression framework is guaranteed to provide correct BV nodes without decompressing the whole BVH. Also, our method is extended to support parallel random access that can utilize the multicore CPU architecture. Our method can achieve up to a 12:1 compression ratio, and more importantly, can decompress 4.2 M BV nodes ({=}135 {\rm MB}) per second by using a single CPU-core. To highlight the benefits of our approach, we apply our method to two different applications: ray tracing and collision detection. We can improve the runtime performance by more than a factor of 4 as compared to using the uncompressed original data. This improvement is a result of the fast decompression performance and reduced data access time by selectively fetching and decompressing small regions of the compressed BVHs requested by applications.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.71","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5128906","Hierarchy and BVH compression;random access;cache-coherent layouts;ray tracing;collision detection.","Runtime;Ray tracing;Moon;Multicore processing;Layout;Graphics;Motion detection;Performance evaluation;Testing;Cache storage","application program interfaces;collision avoidance;data compression;knowledge representation;pattern clustering;ray tracing","random-accessible compressed bounding volume hierarchies;parallel random access;bounding volume nodes;RACBVH representation;API;multicore CPU architecture;ray tracing;collision detection;data access time;cluster","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Data Compression;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Theoretical","15","3","60","","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, the physical layout of keyboards has typically been transplanted into VR for replicating typing experiences in a standard desktop environment. In this paper, we explore how to fully leverage the immersiveness of VR to change the input and output characteristics of physical keyboard interaction within a VR environment. This allows individual physical keys to be reconfigured to the same or different actions and visual output to be distributed in various ways across the VR representation of the keyboard. We explore a set of input and output mappings for reconfiguring the virtual presentation of physical keyboards and probe the resulting design space by specifically designing, implementing and evaluating nine VR-relevant applications: emojis, languages and special characters, application shortcuts, virtual text processing macros, a window manager, a photo browser, a whack-a-mole game, secure password entry and a virtual touch bar. We investigate the feasibility of the applications in a user study with 20 participants and find that, among other things, they are usable in VR.

It is intuitive, practical, and thus often desirable, to interactively select a subset of the data from within that high-dimensional value space for efficient visualization. This approach is straightforward to implement if the dataset is small enough to be stored entirely in-core. However, to handle datasets sized at hundreds of gigabytes and beyond, this simplistic approach becomes infeasible and thus, more sophisticated solutions are needed. In this work, we developed a system that supports efficient visualization of an arbitrary subset, selected by range-queries, of a large multivariate time-varying dataset. By employing specialized data structures and schemes of data distribution, our system can leverage a large number of networked computers as parallel data servers, and guarantees a near optimal load-balance.

We present a framework for the stereoscopic view-dependent visualization of large scale terrain models. We use a quadtree based multiresolution representation for the terrain data. This structure is queried to obtain the view-dependent approximations of the terrain model at different levels of detail. In order not to lose depth information, which is crucial for the stereoscopic visualization, we make use of a different simplification criterion, namely, distance-based angular error threshold. We also present an algorithm for the construction of stereo pairs in order to speed up the view-dependent stereoscopic visualization. The approach we use is the simultaneous generation of the triangles for two stereo images using a single draw-list so that the view frustum culling and vertex activation is done only once for each frame. The cracking problem is solved using the dependency information stored for each vertex. We eliminate the popping artifacts that can occur while switching between different resolutions of the data using morphing. We implemented the proposed algorithms on personal computers and graphics workstations. Performance experiments show that the second eye image can be produced approximately 45 percent faster than drawing the two images separately and a smooth stereoscopic visualization can be achieved at interactive frame rates using continuous multiresolution representation of height fields.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2002.1044519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044519","","Data visualization;Computer graphics;Workstations;Computer Society;Large-scale systems;Microcomputers;Image resolution;Rendering (computer graphics);Geometry;Layout","data visualisation;geophysics computing;quadtrees;stereo image processing;image morphing;software performance evaluation;rendering (computer graphics)","stereoscopic view-dependent visualization;terrain height field visualization;large geometric environments;computer graphics;large scale terrain models;quadtree based multiresolution representation;simplification criterion;distance-based angular error threshold;view frustum culling;vertex activation;cracking problem;image morphing;multiresolution rendering;personal computers;graphics workstations;performance experiments;interactive frame rates;continuous multiresolution representation","","15","3","16","","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From the leaf to root nodes, spheres of various sizes are rendered into multiple-size strokes on the canvas. The proposed sphere hierarchy is developed using multiscale region segmentation. This segmentation task assembles spheres with similar attribute regularities into a meaningful region hierarchy. These attributes include colors, positions, and curvatures. This hierarchy is very useful in the following respects: 1) it ensures the screen-space stroke density, 2) controls different input model abstractions, 3) maintains region structures such as the edges/boundaries at different scales, and 4) renders models interactively. By choosing suitable abstractions, brush stroke, and lighting parameters, we can interactively generate various painterly styles. We also propose a novel scheme that reduces the popping effect in animation sequences.

However, the analysis of this type of data remains a challenge. One issue is the robust selection of neighborhoods â a crucial part of analytic tools such as topological decomposition, clustering and gradient estimation. When extracting the topology of sparsely sampled data, common neighborhood strategies such as k-nearest neighbors may lead to inaccurate results, either due to missing neighborhood connections, which introduce false extrema, or due to spurious connections, which conceal true extrema. Other neighborhoods, such as the Delaunay triangulation, are costly to compute and store even in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, we address these issues. We present two new types of neighborhood graphs: a variation on and a generalization of empty region graphs, which considerably improve the robustness of neighborhood-based analysis tools, such as topological decomposition. Our findings suggest that these neighborhood graphs lead to more accurate topological representations of low- and high- dimensional data sets at relatively low cost, both in terms of storage and computation time. We describe the implications of our work in the analysis and visualization of scalar functions, and provide general strategies for computing and applying our neighborhood graphs towards robust data analysis.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064948","Neighborhood graphs;topology;sparsely sampled data.","Topology;Robustness;Data mining;Noise measurement","data analysis;data visualisation;gradient methods;graph theory;mesh generation;pattern clustering;sampling methods;set theory","sparsely sampled data;sparse irregular sampling;high dimensional signal;topological decomposition;topological clustering;gradient estimation;neighborhood strategy;k-nearest neighbor;neighborhood connection;spurious connection;Delaunay triangulation;empty region graph;neighborhood-based analysis tool;topological decomposition;neighborhood graph;high dimensional data set;low dimensional data set;scalar function visualization;robust data analysis","","15","","54","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approach modifies a pre-existing hierarchy in order to see how a node or subgraph of interest extends out into the larger graph.

A set of carefully designed oriented Gabor filters performs a decomposition of the data and allows for retrieving local shape and texture features. The feature vector obtained from this method is multidimensional and in order to evaluate similar data features, further subspace methods to transform the data onto visualizable attributes, such as R, G, B, have to be determined. For this purpose, a feature based visualization pipeline is proposed consisting of principal component analysis, normalization and a topological mapping network. This process finally renders a R,G,B subspace representation of the multidimensional feature vector.

We show in this paper how a Hasse diagram is an efficient visualization strategy for eliciting different groups and navigating through them. However, we do not limit this strategy to these traditional uses. Instead we show how it can also be used for assisting in indexing new photos. Indexing consists of identifying the event and people in photos. It is an integral phase that takes place before searching and sharing. In our method we use existing indexed photos to index new photos. This is performed through a manual drag and drop procedure followed by a content fusion process that we call 'propagation'. At the core of this process is the necessity to organize and visualize the photos that will be used for indexing in a manner that is easily recognizable and accessible by the user. In this respect we make use of an object Galois sub-hierarchy and display it using a Hasse diagram. The need for an incremental display that maintains the user's mental map also leads us to propose a novel way of building the Hasse diagram. To validate the approach, we present some tests conducted with a sample of users that confirm the interest of this organization, visualization and indexation approach.

We enable the automatic analysis of a signal defined on the nodes of the network, making viable the robust detection of network properties. Specifically, we use a fast approximation of a graph wavelet transform to derive a set of wavelet coefficients, which are then used to identify activity patterns on large networks, including their temporal recurrence.

Our model can be applied to predict not only realtime gaze positions but also gaze positions in the near future and can achieve better performance than prior method. In terms of realtime prediction, DGaze achieves a 22.0% improvement over prior method in dynamic scenes and obtains an improvement of 9.5% in static scenes, based on using the angular distance as the evaluation metric. We also propose a variant of our model called DGaze_ET that can be used to predict future gaze positions with higher precision by combining accurate past gaze data gathered using an eye tracker. We further analyze our CNN architecture and verify the effectiveness of each component in our model. We apply DGaze to gaze-contingent rendering and a game, and also present the evaluation results from a user study.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.2973473","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1002700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632003,61661146002,61631001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8998375","Gaze prediction;convolutional neural network;eye tracking;dynamic scene;gaze-contingent rendering;virtual reality","Predictive models;Gaze tracking;Solid modeling;Head;Analytical models;Data models;Rendering (computer graphics)","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;gaze tracking;helmet mounted displays;human computer interaction;rendering (computer graphics);statistical analysis;virtual reality","dynamic virtual scenes;HMD-based applications;dynamic object positions;head rotation velocities;object position sequence;head velocity sequence;realtime gaze positions;DGaze_ET;CNN architecture;gaze-contingent rendering;CNN-based gaze prediction model;users eye tracking data;statistical analysis;helmet mounted displays","Adolescent;Adult;Computer Graphics;Eye-Tracking Technology;Female;Fixation, Ocular;Humans;Male;Neural Networks, Computer;Software;Task Performance and Analysis;Young Adult","14","","46","IEEE","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, how such social information embedded in a visualization impacts a viewer's interpretation of the data remains unknown. Inspired by recent interactive visualizations that display people's expectations of data against the data, we conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate the effect of showing social information in the form of other people's expectations on people's ability to recall the data, the degree to which they adjust their expectations to align with the data, and their trust in the accuracy of the data. We found that social information that exhibits a high degree of consensus lead participants to recall the data more accurately relative to participants who were exposed to the data alone. Additionally, participants trusted the accuracy of the data less and were more likely to maintain their initial expectations when other people's expectations aligned with their own initial expectations but not with the data. We conclude by characterizing the design space for visualizing others' expectations alongside data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2745240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8019830","Social influence;Social visualization;Data interpretation","Data visualization;Uncertainty;Collaboration;Social network services;Market research;Focusing;Data analysis","data visualisation;human computer interaction;social networking (online)","social artifacts;social information;input data visualization;interactive visualizations;consensus degree","Computer Graphics;Crowdsourcing;Data Visualization;Databases, Factual;Humans;Mental Recall;Motivation;Social Perception;Trust","14","","40","IEEE","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They are often created as a mosaic of many smaller images. The mosaic acquisition can take many hours causing the individual images to differ in exposure and lighting conditions. A blending operation is often necessary to give the appearance of a seamless image. The blending quality depends on the magnitude of discontinuity along the image boundaries. Often, new boundaries, or seams, are first computed that minimize this transition. Current techniques based on multi-labeling Graph Cuts are too slow and memory intensive for gigapixel sized panoramas. In this paper, we present a parallel, out-of-core seam computing technique that is fast, has small memory footprint, and is capable of running efficiently on different types of parallel systems. Its maximum memory usage is configurable, in the form of a cache, which can improve performance by reducing redundant disk I/O and computations. It shows near-perfect scaling on symmetric multiprocessing systems and good scaling on clusters and distributed shared memory systems. Our technique improves the time required to compute seams for gigapixel imagery from many hours (or even days) to just a few minutes, while still producing boundaries with energy that is on-par with Graph Cuts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2366128","NSF(grant numbers:OCI-0906379); NSF(grant numbers:OCI-0904631); DOE/NEUP(grant numbers:120341); DOE/MAPD(grant numbers:DESC000192); DOE/LLNL(grant numbers:B597476); DOE/Codesign(grant numbers:P01180734); DOE/SciDAC(grant numbers:DESC0007446); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940309","Panorama;Seams;Gigapixel;Parallel;Scalable;Out-Of-Core;MPI;Panorama;seams;gigapixel;parallel;scalable;out-of-core;MPI","Image edge detection;Weaving;Labeling;Memory management;Lighting;Image resolution;Robots","image processing;parallel processing","digital photography;distributed shared memory systems;clusters;symmetric multiprocessing systems;memory footprint;parallel out-of-core seam computing technique;digital image application;gigapixel panoramas;distributed seams","","14","","29","IEEE","30 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the existence and properties of closed geodesics on smooth surfaces have been widely studied in mathematics community, relatively little progress has been made on how to compute them on polygonal surfaces. Most existing algorithms simply consider the mesh as a graph and so the resultant loops are restricted only on mesh edges, which are far from the actual geodesics. This paper is the first to prove the existence and uniqueness of geodesic loop restricted on a closed face sequence; it contributes also with an efficient algorithm to iteratively evolve an initial closed path on a given mesh into an exact geodesic loop within finite steps. Our proposed algorithm takes only an O(k) space complexity and an O(mk) time complexity (experimentally), where m is the number of vertices in the region bounded by the initial loop and the resultant geodesic loop, and k is the average number of edges in the edge sequences that the evolving loop passes through. In contrast to the existing geodesic curvature flow methods which compute an approximate geodesic loop within a predefined threshold, our method is exact and can apply directly to triangular meshes without needing to solve any differential equation with a numerical solver; it can run at interactive speed, e.g., in the order of milliseconds, for a mesh with around 50K vertices, and hence, significantly outperforms existing algorithms. Actually, our algorithm could run at interactive speed even for larger meshes. Besides the complexity of the input mesh, the geometric shape could also affect the number of evolving steps, i.e., the performance. We motivate our algorithm with an interactive shape segmentation example shown later in the paper.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928345","Discrete geodesic;geodesic loop;triangular mesh.","Face;Shape;Approximation algorithms;Image edge detection;Complexity theory;Measurement;Approximation methods","computational complexity;computational geometry;differential geometry;image segmentation;mesh generation","differential topology;differential geometry;mathematics community;polygonal surfaces;closed face sequence;closed path;exact geodesic loop;finite steps;space complexity;time complexity;edge sequences;geodesic curvature flow method;triangular mesh edge;interactive speed;geometric shape;interactive shape segmentation","","14","","38","IEEE","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We demonstrate how HEDA is a generic, interactive visualization component that can extend common visualization techniques while respecting the structure of the familiar layout. HEDA is a tabular visualization building block that enables individuals to visually observe, explore, and query their familiar visualizations through manipulation of embedded multivariate data.

Often, a high level of abstraction hides low level details, which makes it difficult to directly access the underlying computing platform, which would be important to achieve an optimal performance. Therefore, we propose a layer structure developed for modern and sustainable visualization systems allowing developers to interact with all contained abstraction levels.

The core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes.

Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what naÃ¯ve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly influenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would find the same patterns to be most visually salient. This result reflects a psychological phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge, where an expert struggles to re-create the state of mind of a novice.

The estimates obtained from this process are then used as a basis for estimating the position and orientation of the camera at every frame in the video clip.

The result is a highly compact visualization that gives a succinct overview of the graph with guaranteed visibility of every graph node.

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies.

Alternatively, we show that it is feasible to collect and analyze eye-tracking information in data space. Specifically, the visual layout of visualizations with open source code that can be instrumented is known at rendering time, and thus can be used to relate gaze-coordinates to visualization and data objects that users view, in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by showing that data collected using this methodology from nine users working with an interactive visualization, was well aligned with the tasks that those users were asked to solve, and similar to annotation data produced by five human coders. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm that, given our instrumented visualization, could translate gaze-coordinates into viewed objects with greater accuracy than simply binning gazes into dynamically defined AOIs.

The 3D models are thus decorated with the desired color texture, as well as a thin, polished protective cover. The precomputation involves a physical simulation of the thermoforming process to compute the correct color pattern on the plastic sheet, and the vent hole layout on the 3D model for air pocket elimination.

Yet as graphs grow more complex, these depictions can become difficult to understand. Quilts are matrix-based depictions for layered graphs designed to address this problem. In this research, we first improve Quilts by developing three design alternatives, and then compare the best of these alternatives to better-known node-link and matrix depictions. A primary weakness in Quilts is their depiction of skip links, links that do not simply connect to a succeeding layer. Therefore in our first study, we compare Quilts using color-only, text-only, and mixed (color and text) skip link depictions, finding that path finding with the color-only depiction is significantly slower and less accurate, and that in certain cases, the mixed depiction offers an advantage over the text-only depiction. In our second study, we compare Quilts using the mixed depiction to node-link diagrams and centered matrices. Overall results show that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts (46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams. This speed advantage is still greater in large graphs (e.g. in 200 node graphs, 55.4 secs vs. 71.1 secs for node-link and 84.2 secs for matrix depictions).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064992","Graph drawing;layered graphs;matrix based depiction;node-link diagram.","Time measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Analysis of variance;Graphics","flowcharting;graphs;matrix algebra","quilts;layered graph depiction;flow charts;matrix depiction;skip link depiction;color-only depiction;text-only depiction;node-link diagrams;matrix diagrams","","13","","16","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our technique visualizes the dynamics of these rules as they evolve over time. Using the data produced by KaSim, an open source stochastic simulator of rule-based models written in the Kappa language, DINs provide a node-link diagram that represents the influence that each rule has on the other rules. That is, rather than representing individual biological components or types, we instead represent the rules about them (as nodes) and the current influence of these rules (as links). Using our interactive DIN-Viz software tool, researchers are able to query this dynamic network to find meaningful patterns about biological processes, and to identify salient aspects of complex rule-based models.

As a result, the object interactions are application independent and only a single scheme is required to handle all interactions in the virtual world. In order to have more dynamic interactions, we also created a new and efficient way for human users to dynamically interact within virtual worlds through their avatar. In particular, we show how inverse kinematics can be used to increase the interaction possibilities and realism in collaborative virtual environments. This results in a higher feeling of presence for connected users and allows for easy, on-the-fly creation of new interactions.

We generalize existing occlusion culling algorithms, intended for static scenes, to handle dynamic scenes having numerous moving objects. The data structure used by an occlusion culling method is updated to reflect the objects' possible positions. To avoid updating the structure for every dynamic object at each frame, a temporal bounding volume (TBV) is created for each occluded dynamic object, using some known constraints on the object's motion. The TBV is inserted into the structure instead of the object. Subsequently, the object is ignored as long as the TBV is occluded and guaranteed to contain the object. The generalized algorithms' rendering time is linearly affected only by the scene's visible parts, not by hidden parts or by occluded dynamic objects. Our techniques also save communications in distributed graphic systems, e.g., multiuser virtual environments, by eliminating update messages for hidden dynamic objects.

Next, we express all curves in a given cluster in terms of a centroid curve and a complementary term, via a set of so-called principal component functions. Based on the above, we propose a two-fold contribution: First, we use cluster centroids to design a new bundling method for 2D and 3D curve-sets. Secondly, we deform the cluster centroids and generate new curves along them, which enables us to modify the underlying data in a statistically-controlled way via its simplified (bundled) view.

From this data, many people might confidently state that a before-school breakfast program would lead to higher grades. This is a reasoning error, because correlation does not necessarily indicate causation - X and Y can be correlated without one directly causing the other. While this error is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way that the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments, we examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this reasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the breakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link. We asked participants to rate their level of agreement that the relation was correlated, which they rated appropriately as high. However, participants also expressed high agreement with a causal interpretation of the data. Levels of support for the causal interpretation were not equally strong across visualization types: causality ratings were highest for text descriptions and bar graphs, but weaker for scatter plots. But is this effect driven by bar graphs aggregating data into two groups or by the visual encoding type? We isolated data aggregation versus visual encoding type and examined their individual effect on perceived causality. Overall, different visualization designs afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data. High levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher perceived causality in data. Participants perceived line and dot visual encodings as more causal than bar encodings. Our results demonstrate how some visualization designs trigger stronger causal links while choosing others can help mitigate unwarranted perceptions of causality.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805448","Information Visualization;Correlation and Causation;Visualization Design;Reasoning Affordance","Correlation;Data visualization;Bars;Task analysis;Visualization;Cognition;Encoding","causality;cognition;data visualisation;educational computing;educational institutions;graph theory","causal interpretation;visualization types;causality ratings;bar graphs;data aggregation;bar encodings;data visualization;grade point average;before-school breakfast program;crowdsourced experiments;text descriptions","","13","","50","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although many methods can be applied to generate these effects, the rendering performance is not satisfactory for interactive applications. In this paper, complex ray-object intersections are simplified so that the intersections can be computed on a GPU, and an iterative computing scheme based on the depth buffers is used for correcting the approximate results caused by the simplification. As a result, reflections and refractions of environment maps and nearby geometry can be rendered on a GPU interactively without preprocessing. We can even achieve interactive recursive reflections and refractions by using an object-impostor technique. Moreover, caustic effects caused by reflections and refractions can be rendered by placing the eye at the light.

We employ demand-driven tiled, multiresolution image streaming and prefetching to efficiently utilize available bandwidth while providing the maximum resolution user can perceive from a given viewpoint. Since image data is the only input to our system, our approach is generally applicable to all visualization and graphics rendering applications capable of generating image files in an ordered fashion.

Although many mesh denoising methods have proven to be effective in noise removal, they hardly work well on noisy point clouds. We propose a new multi-patch collaborative method for point cloud denoising, which is solved as a low-rank matrix recovery problem. Unlike the traditional single-patch based denoising approaches, our approach is inspired by the geometric statistics which indicate that a number of surface patches sharing approximate geometric properties always exist within a 3D model. Based on this observation, we define a rotation-invariant height-map patch (HMP) for each point by robust Bi-PCA encoding bilaterally filtered normal information, and group its non-local similar patches together. Within each group, all patches are geometrically similar, while suffering from noise. We pack the height maps of each group into an HMP matrix, whose initial rank is high, but can be significantly reduced. We design an improved low-rank recovery model, by imposing a graph constraint to filter noise. Experiments on synthetic and raw datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both noise removal and feature preservation.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2920817","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772267,61502137); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:NE2014402,NE2016004); NUAA Fundamental Research Funds(grant numbers:NS2015053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730533","Point cloud denoising;low-rank matrix recovery;height-map patch;self-similarity","Three-dimensional displays;Noise reduction;Collaboration;Solid modeling;Cameras;Surface reconstruction;Image reconstruction","filtering theory;image denoising;image reconstruction;matrix algebra;mesh generation;principal component analysis","approximate geometric properties;rotation-invariant height-map patch;bilaterally filtered normal information;nonlocal similar patches;HMP matrix;initial rank;low-rank recovery model;graph constraint;noise removal;depth cameras;raw geometric features;reconstructed mesh;mesh denoising methods;noisy point clouds;multipatch collaborative method;point cloud denoising;low-rank matrix recovery problem;geometric statistics;surface patches;multipatch collaborative point cloud denoising;robust Bi-PCA encoding","","13","","63","IEEE","4 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique is applicable to any smooth implicitly defined reflecting surface that is equipped with a ray intersection procedure; it is also extremely efficient as it employs local perturbations to interpolate point samples analytically. After ray tracing a sparse set of reflection paths with respect to a given vantage point and static reflecting surfaces, the algorithm rapidly approximates reflections of arbitrary points in 3-space by expressing them as perturbations of nearby points with known reflections. The reflection of each new point is approximated to second-order accuracy by applying a closed-form perturbation formula to one or more nearby reflection paths. This formula is derived from the Taylor expansion of a reflection path and is based on first and second-order path derivatives. After preprocessing, the approach is fast enough to compute reflections of tessellated diffuse objects in arbitrary curved surfaces at interactive rates using standard graphics hardware. The resulting images are nearly indistinguishable from ray traced images that take several orders of magnitude longer to generate.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.879786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879786","","Perturbation methods;Optical reflection;Ray tracing;Graphics;Hardware;Lighting;Computational modeling;Radiometry;Acceleration;Layout","ray tracing;reflection;perturbation techniques;interactive systems;computer graphic equipment","perturbation methods;interactive specular reflections;interactive approximation;arbitrary curved surfaces;smooth implicitly defined reflecting surface;ray intersection procedure;local perturbations;point samples;ray tracing;sparse set;reflection paths;vantage point;static reflecting surfaces;arbitrary points;3-space;second-order accuracy;closed-form perturbation formula;nearby reflection paths;Taylor expansion;reflection path;second-order path derivatives;preprocessing;tessellated diffuse objects;interactive rates;standard graphics hardware;ray traced images","","13","","26","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, the conventional global illumination algorithms for the estimation of the diffuse surface interreflection make heavy usage of intra- and interobject visibility calculations, so they are time-consuming, and using them in real-time graphics applications can be prohibitive for complex scenes. Modern illumination approximations, such as ambient occlusion variants, use precalculated or frame-dependent data to reduce the problem to a local shading one. This paper presents a fast real-time method for visibility sampling using volumetric data in order to produce accurate inter- and intraobject ambient occlusion. The proposed volume sampling technique disassociates surface representation data from the visibility calculations, and therefore, makes the method suitable for both primitive-order or screen-order rendering, such as deferred rendering.

To support the case, we have implemented RingText whose design is based on a circular layout with two concentric circles. The outer circle is subdivided into regions containing letters. Selection is made by using a virtual cursor controlled by the user's head movements-entering a letter region triggers a selection and moving back into the inner circle resets the selection. The design of RingText follows an iterative process, where we initially conduct one first study to investigate the optimal number of letters per region, inner circle size, and alphabet starting location. We then optimize its design by selecting the most suitable features from the first study: one letter per region, narrowing the trigger area to lower error rates, and creating candidate regions that incorporate two suggested words to appear next to the current letter region (close to the cursor) using a dynamic (rather than fixed) approach. Our second study compares text entry performance of RingText with four other hands-free techniques and the results show that RingText outperforms them. Finally, we run a third study lasting four consecutive days with 10 participants (5 novice users and 5 expert users) doing two daily sessions and the results show that RingText is quite efficient and yields a low error rate. At the end of the eighth session, the novice users can achieve a text entry speed of 11.30 WPM after 60 minutes of training while the expert (more experienced) users can reach an average text entry speed of 13.24 WPM after 90 minutes of training.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2898736","XJTLU(grant numbers:KSF-A-03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8642443","Virtual Reality;text entry;circular keyboard layout;mobile head-worn/mounted displays;dwell-free input","Layout;Keyboards;Error analysis;Training;Head-mounted displays;Resists;Dynamics","feature selection;helmet mounted displays;keyboards;mobile computing;text analysis;virtual reality","RingText;hands-free text entry;mobile head-mounted displays;head motions;dwell-free text entry;mobile HMD;virtual cursor;feature selection;virtual reality","Adolescent;Adult;Female;Head Movements;Humans;Male;Smart Glasses;Text Messaging;Virtual Reality;Young Adult","13","","47","IEEE","14 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The higher-level structure of the graph is a true tree with meta-nodes of variable size that contain each biconnected component.

In this paper, we propose a novel visual technique, UnTangle Map, for visualizing probabilistic multi-labels. In our proposed visualization, data items are placed inside a web of connected triangles, with labels assigned to the triangle vertices such that nearby labels are more relevant to each other. The positions of the data items are determined based on the probabilistic associations between items and labels. UnTangle Map provides both (a) an automatic label placement algorithm, and (b) adaptive interactions that allow users to control the label positioning for different information needs. Our work makes a unique contribution by providing an effective way to investigate the relationship between data items and their probabilistic labels, as well as the relationships among labels.

Example-based synthesis methods such as video textures are an appealing alternative to conventional model-based methods, but current techniques are unable to represent and satisfy constraints between video sprites and the scene. This paper describes how to synthesize crowds by segmenting pedestrians from input videos of natural crowds and optimally placing them into an output video while satisfying environmental constraints imposed by the scene. We introduce crowd tubes, a representation of video objects designed to compose a crowd of video billboards while avoiding collisions between static and dynamic obstacles. The approach consists of representing crowd tube samples and constraint violations with a conflict graph. The maximal independent set yields a dense constraint-satisyfing crowd composition. We present a prototype system for the capture, analysis, synthesis, and control of video-based crowds.

The estimation method relies on the results of a psychophysical study that we conducted to investigate the legibility of projected characters on various types of surfaces that deform their shapes, decrease their contrasts, or cast shadows on them. Our technique computes a label layout by minimizing the energy function using a genetic algorithm (GA). The terms in the function quantitatively evaluate different aspects of the layout quality. Conventional label layout solvers evaluate anchor regions and leader lines. In addition to these evaluations, we design our energy function to deal with the following unique factors, which are inherent in projection-based AR applications: the estimated legibility value and the disconnection of the projected leader line.

For each length of the growing RNA chain there exists a folding landscape. We visualize the sequence of folding landscapes by an animation of the corresponding barrier trees.

We here propose the use of graph invariants to determine suitable parameters automatically. This allows us to perform adaptive filtering to obtain drawings in which the cluster structure is most prominent. The approach is based on an empirical relationship between input and output characteristics that is derived from real and synthetic networks.

We address the challenge of color-mapping multivariate data.

Likewise, schemes that take a more artistic approach through color mixing and the like also face limits when it comes to the number of variables they can encode. Our approach does not have these limitations. It is data driven in that it determines a proper and consistent color map from first embedding the data samples into a circular interactive multivariate color mapping display (ICD) and then fusing this display with a convex (CIE HCL) color space. The variables (data attributes) are arranged in terms of their similarity and mapped to the ICD's boundary to control the embedding. Using this layout, the color of a multivariate data sample is then obtained via modified generalized barycentric coordinate interpolation of the map.

Our key idea is to combine recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and adversarial training for human motion modeling. We first describe an efficient method for training an RNN model from prerecorded motion data. We implement RNNs with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells because they are capable of addressing the nonlinear dynamics and long term temporal dependencies present in human motions. Next, we train a refiner network using an adversarial loss, similar to generative adversarial networks (GANs), such that refined motion sequences are indistinguishable from real mocap data using a discriminative network. The resulting model is appealing for motion synthesis and control because it is compact, contact-aware, and can generate an infinite number of naturally looking motions with infinite lengths. Our experiments show that motions generated by our deep learning model are always highly realistic and comparable to high-quality motion capture data. We demonstrate the power and effectiveness of our models by exploring a variety of applications, ranging from random motion synthesis, online/offline motion control, and motion filtering.

This system allows to move a gigabyte-sized probe inside a total volume of several tens or hundreds of gigabytes in real-time. While the size of the probe is limited by the total amount of texture memory on the cluster, the size of the total data set has no theoretical limit. The cluster is used as a distributed graphics processing unit that both aggregates graphics power and graphics memory. A hardware-accelerated volume renderer runs in parallel on the cluster nodes and the final image compositing is implemented using a pipelined sort-last rendering algorithm. Meanwhile, volume bricking and volume paging allow efficient data caching. On each rendering node, a distributed hierarchical cache system implements a global software-based distributed shared memory on the cluster. In case of a cache miss, this system first checks page residency on the other cluster nodes instead of directly accessing local disks. Using two gigabit Ethernet network interfaces per node, we accelerate data fetching by a factor of 4 compared to directly accessing local disks.

While several existing tools allow users to visualize pre-defined networks, creating these networks from raw data remains a challenging task, often requiring users to program custom scripts or write complex SQL commands. Some existing tools also allow users to both visualize and model networks. Interaction techniques adopted by these tools often assume users know the exact conditions for defining edges in the resulting networks. This assumption may not always hold true, however. In cases where users do not know much about attributes in the dataset or when there are several attributes to choose from, users may not know which attributes they could use to formulate linking conditions. We propose an alternate interaction technique to model networks that allows users to demonstrate to the system a subset of nodes and links they wish to see in the resulting network. The system, in response, recommends conditions that can be used to model networks based on the specified nodes and links. In this paper, we show how such a demonstration-based interaction technique can be used to model networks by employing it in a prototype tool, Graphiti. Through multiple usage scenarios, we show how Graphiti not only allows users to model networks from a tabular dataset but also facilitates updating a pre-defined network with additional edge types.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744843","Tennenbaum Institute; Georgia Tech; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8019835","Network modeling;visual analytics;user interaction","Tools;Data visualization;Joining processes;Data models;Prototypes;Image color analysis;Computational modeling","data visualisation;formal specification;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;interactive systems;SQL","predefined networks;cluster identification;custom scripts programming;attribute-based edges;interactive specification;tabular dataset;Graphiti;demonstration-based interaction technique;complex SQL commands;resulting network;model networks;node-link diagrams;network visualizations;network modeling","","12","","49","IEEE","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

High-throughput microscopy volumes are also difficult to manage since they can require several terabytes of storage, even though the total volume of the embedded structure is much smaller. Filaments in microscopy data sets are difficult to segment because their diameter is often near the sampling resolution of the microscope, yet these networks can span large regions of the data set. We describe a novel method to trace filaments through scalar volume data sets that is robust to both noisy and undersampled data.

In this paper, we show that, with a well-designed multi-layer perceptual loss, we are able to obtain aesthetic and neat simplification results preserving semantically important global structures as well as fine details without blurriness and excessive emphasis on local structures. To do so, we design a multi-layer discriminator by fusing all VGG feature layers to differentiate sketches and clean lines.

Our framework, called Persistence Atlas, enables the visualization of the dominant spatial patterns of critical points, along with statistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas represents in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a confidence map for the appearance of critical points. As a by-product, our method also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire ensemble, highlighting the main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion of Persistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which leverages the robustness to noise of topological persistence to better emphasize salient features. We show how to leverage spectral embedding to represent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, where distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical point layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily carried out. Further, we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be leveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence regions for the appearance of critical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially parallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the confidence regions provided by the persistence atlas is quantitatively evaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering approach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of real-life datasets, where clear trends in feature layouts are identified and analyzed.

The GNLB computes the saliency response at a position by a weighted sum of features at all positions, and enables us to produce results that outperform existing deep saliency models. Second, we formulate a joint optimization framework to take saliency information when iteratively separating textures from structures: on the texture layer, we smooth out structures with the help of the saliency information and migrate structures from the texture to structure layer, while on the structure layer, we adopt another deep model to detect edges and simultaneous sparse coding to push textures back to the texture layer.

Our reusing scheme adapts to the change of incoming radiance by updating the indirect lighting only where there is a significant change. By reusing data in several frames, our method removes the flickering artifacts and yields a significant speedup compared to classical computation in which a new cache is computed for every frame.

While multimodal interaction with network visualization seems like a promising idea, many open questions remain. For instance, do users actually prefer multimodal input over unimodal input, and if so, why? Does it enable them to interact more naturally, or does having multiple modes of input confuse users? To answer such questions, we conducted a qualitative user study in the context of a network visualization tool, comparing speech- and touch-based unimodal interfaces to a multimodal interface combining the two. Our results confirm that participants strongly prefer multimodal input over unimodal input attributing their preference to: 1) the freedom of expression, 2) the complementary nature of speech and touch, and 3) integrated interactions afforded by the combination of the two modalities.

We want to understand the relationships between dimensions of data, but lack flexible techniques for exploration beyond low-order relationships. Current visual techniques for multidimensional data analysis focus on binary conjunctive relationships between dimensions. Recent techniques, such as cross-filtering on an attribute relationship graph, facilitate the exploration of some higher-order conjunctive relationships, but require a great deal of care and precision to do so effectively. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the expressive power of existing visual querying systems and describes a more flexible approach in which users can explore n-ary conjunctive inter- and intra- dimensional relationships by interactively constructing queries as visual hypergraphs. In a hypergraph query, nodes represent subsets of values and hyperedges represent conjunctive relationships. Analysts can dynamically build and modify the query using sequences of simple interactions. The hypergraph serves not only as a query specification, but also as a compact visual representation of the interactive state. Using examples from several domains, focusing on the digital humanities, we describe the design considerations for developing the querying system and incorporating it into visual analysis tools. We analyze query expressiveness with regard to the kinds of questions it can and cannot pose, and describe how it simultaneously expands the expressiveness of and is complemented by cross-filtering.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634154","Visual analytics;Data analysis;Data visualization;Marine vehicles;Semantics;Database languages;digital humanities;Graph search;graph query language;multidimensional data;attribute relationship graphs;multivariate data analysis;higher-order conjunctive queries;visual query language","Visual analytics;Data analysis;Data visualization;Marine vehicles;Semantics;Database languages","data analysis;data visualisation;query processing","visual analysis;higher-order conjunctive relationships;multidimensional data analysis;hypergraph query system;visual exploration;binary conjunctive relationships;attribute relationship graph;visual querying systems;conjunctive interdimensional relationships;conjunctive intradimensional relationships;query specification;digital humanities;query expressiveness;cross-filtering","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Theoretical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface","12","","30","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the visual layouts of storylines are not enhanced accordingly despite the improvement in the performance and extension of its application area. Existing methods attempt to achieve several shared optimization goals, such as reducing empty space and minimizing line crossings and wiggles. However, these goals do not always produce optimal results when compared to hand-drawn storylines. We conducted a preliminary study to learn how users translate a narrative into a hand-drawn storyline and check whether the visual elements in hand-drawn illustrations can be mapped back to appropriate narrative contexts. We also compared the hand-drawn storylines with storylines generated by the state-of-the-art methods and found they have significant differences. Our findings led to a design space that summarizes 1) how artists utilize narrative elements and 2) the sequence of actions artists follow to portray expressive and attractive storylines. We developed iStoryline, an authoring tool for integrating high-level user interactions into optimization algorithms and achieving a balance between hand-drawn storylines and automatic layouts. iStoryline allows users to create novel storyline visualizations easily according to their preferences by modifying the automatically generated layouts.

By transforming a flow field to a graph representation, we enable observation and exploration of the relationships among field line clusters, spatiotemporal regions and their interconnection in the transformed space. FlowGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts field line clusters and spatiotemporal regions in various levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides flow field exploration and understanding.

In this paper, we study caching and prefetching, an important aspect of such architecture design, in order to optimize the fetch time in a remote visualization system. Unlike a processor cache or Web cache, caching for remote visualization is unique and complex. Through actual experimentation and numerical simulation, we have discovered ways to systematically evaluate and search for optimal configurations of remote visualization caches under various scenarios, such as different network speeds, sizes of data for user requests, prefetch schemes, cache depletion schemes, etc. We have also designed a practical infrastructure software to adaptively optimize the caching architecture of general remote visualization systems, when a different application is started or the network condition varies.

With that model, spectral light material interaction can be integrated into existing volume rendering methods at almost no penalty. In addition, slow rendering methods can profit from the new technique of postillumination-generating spectral images in real-time for arbitrary light spectra under a fixed viewpoint. Thus, the capability of spectral rendering to create distinct impressions of a scene under different lighting conditions is established as a method of real-time interaction. Although we use an achromatic opacity in our rendering, we show how spectral rendering permits different data set features to be emphasized or hidden as long as they have not been entirely obscured. The use of postillumination is an order of magnitude faster than changing the transfer function and repeating the projection step. To put the user in control of the spectral visualization, we devise a new widget, a ""light-dial"", for interactively changing the illumination and include a usability study of this new light space exploration tool. Applied to spectral transfer functions, different lights bring out or hide specific qualities of the data.

In particular, the study of the temporal evolution of cyclones requires a robust depression tracking framework. To cope with this demand we propose a pipeline for the exploration of cyclones and their temporal evolution. This entails a generic framework for their identification and tracking. The fact that depressions and cyclones are not well-defined objects and their shape and size characteristics change over time makes this task especially challenging. Our method combines the robustness of topological approaches and the detailed tracking information from optical flow analysis. At first cyclones are identified within each time step based on well-established topological concepts. Then candidate tracks are computed from an optical flow field. These tracks are clustered within a moving time window to distill dominant coherent cyclone movements, which are then forwarded to a final tracking step. In contrast to previous methods our method requires only a few intuitive parameters. An integration into an exploratory framework helps in the study of cyclone movement by identifying smooth, representative tracks. Multiple case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in tracking cyclones, both in the northern and southern hemisphere.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2810068","Department of Science and Technology, India(grant numbers:DST/SJF/ETA-02/2015-16); Indian Institute of Science(grant numbers:JATP/RG/PROJ/2015/16); Swedish e-Science Research Center (SeRC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8303701","Cyclone;scalar field;time-varying data;track graph;spatio-temporal clustering;tracking","Cyclones;Tracking;Meteorology;Object tracking;Image sequences;Storms","atmospheric movements;image sequences;object tracking;storms;topology","candidate tracks;dominant coherent cyclone movements;final tracking step;exploratory framework;cyclone movement;smooth tracks;cyclone identification;temporal evolution;robust depression tracking framework;generic framework;detailed tracking information;depression analysis","","11","","29","IEEE","27 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional 3D / 4D medical image reconstruction requires near hundreds of projections, which cost insufferable computational time and deliver undesirable high imaging / radiation dose to human subjects. Moreover, it always needs further notorious processes to segment or extract the accurate 3D organ models subsequently. The computational time and imaging dose can be reduced by decreasing the number of projections, but the reconstructed image quality is degraded accordingly. To our knowledge, there is no method directly and explicitly reconstructing multiple 3D organ meshes from a single 2D medical grayscale image on the fly. Given single-view 2D medical images, e.g., 3D / 4D-CT projections or X-ray images, our end-to-end DeepOrganNet framework can efficiently and effectively reconstruct 3D / 4D lung models with a variety of geometric shapes by learning the smooth deformation fields from multiple templates based on a trivariate tensor-product deformation technique, leveraging an informative latent descriptor extracted from input 2D images. The proposed method can guarantee to generate high-quality and high-fidelity manifold meshes for 3D / 4D lung models; while, all current deep learning based approaches on the shape reconstruction from a single image cannot. The major contributions of this work are to accurately reconstruct the 3D organ shapes from 2D single-view projection, significantly improve the procedure time to allow on-the-fly visualization, and dramatically reduce the imaging dose for human subjects. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional reconstruction method and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive 3D and 4D examples, including both synthetic phantom and real patient datasets. The efficiency of the proposed method shows that it only needs several milliseconds to generate organ meshes with 10K vertices, which has great potential to be used in real-time image guided radiation therapy (IGRT).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934369","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1816511,CNS-1647200,OAC-1657364,OAC-1845962,OAC-1910469); Wayne State University Subaward(grant numbers:4207299A,CNS-1821962,NIH 1R56AG060822-01A1,NIH 1R44HL145826-01A1,ZJNSF LZ16F020002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809843","Deep deformation network;organ meshes;3D / 4D shapes;2D projections;single-view","Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Shape;Strain;Solid modeling;Biomedical imaging;Two dimensional displays","computer graphics;computerised tomography;image reconstruction;image resolution;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing;phantoms;radiation therapy","accurate 3D organ models;imaging dose;reconstructed image quality;organ meshes;single 2D medical grayscale image;4D-CT projections;X-ray images;end-to-end DeepOrganNet framework;input 2D images;shape reconstruction;single image;3D organ shapes;2D single-view projection;traditional reconstruction method;real-time image;single-view projections;deep deformation network;deep neural network based method;single-view medical images;insufferable computational time;temperature 10.0 K","Algorithms;Cone-Beam Computed Tomography;Deep Learning;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Lung;Lung Neoplasms;Neural Networks, Computer;Phantoms, Imaging","11","","54","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To generate a map, the proposed method includes algorithms for estimating road significance and for deforming a road network according to various geometric and aesthetic constraints.

Therefore, the resulting map can serve as a tourist or destination map that not only provides visual aids for route planning and navigation tasks, but also visually emphasizes the presentation of a theme in a map for the purpose of advertising. In the experiments, the demonstrations of map generations show that our method enables map generation systems to generate deformed tourist and destination maps efficiently.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2312010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6774478","Map generation;mesh warping;information visualization","Roads;Shape;Optimization;Navigation;Visualization;Network topology;Distortion measurement","advertising;cartography;optimisation","road network drawing;mental maps;tourist maps;destination maps;thematic maps;road network topologies;road network warping method;map generation;optimization process;geometric constraints;aesthetic constraints;route planning;navigation tasks;advertising","","11","","31","IEEE","17 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The hand is capable of accomplishing diverse tasks such as pointing, gripping, twisting, and tearing. However, there is not much work that considers using the hand as input in distributed virtual environments (DVEs), in particular, over the Internet. The main reasons are that the Internet suffers from high network latency, which affects interaction, and the hand has many degrees of freedom, which adds additional challenges to synchronizing the collaboration. In this paper, we propose a prediction method specifically designed for human hand motion to address the network latency problem in DVEs. Through a thorough analysis of finger motion, we have identified various finger motion constraints, and we propose a constraint-based motion prediction method for hand motion. To reduce the average prediction error under high network latency, for example, over the Internet, we further propose a revised dead-reckoning scheme here. Our performance results show that the proposed prediction method produces a lower prediction error than some popular methods, and the revised dead-reckoning scheme produces a lower average prediction error than the traditional dead-reckoning scheme, particularly at high network latency.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.1056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359479","Motion Prediction;hand motion prediction;hand interaction;network latency;Motion Prediction;hand motion prediction;hand interaction;network latency","Virtual environment;Delay;Motion analysis;Prediction methods;IP networks;Fingers;Internet;Collaborative work;Design methodology;Humans","groupware;Internet;virtual reality","human hand motion prediction;distributed virtual environment;Internet suffering;network latency problem;finger motion analysis;constraint-based motion prediction method;collaborative design","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Hand;Hand;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Internet;Models, Biological;Movement;User-Computer Interface","11","1","35","","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the pervasive role of the Internet as a means of sharing information across networks, its misuse for destructive purposes, such as spreading malicious code, compromising remote hosts, or damaging data through unauthorized access, has grown immensely in the recent years. The classical way of monitoring the operation of large network systems is by analyzing the system logs for detecting anomalies. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Network Map, an interactive visualization technique for gaining a deeper insight into network flow behavior by means of user-driven visual exploration. Our approach is meant as an enhancement to conventional analysis methods based on statistics or machine learning. We use multidimensional modeling combined with position and display awareness to view source and target data of the hosts in a hierarchical fashion with the ability to interactively change the level of aggregation or apply filtering. The interdisciplinary approach integrating data warehouse technology, information visualization, and decision support, brings about the benefit of efficiently collecting the input data and aggregating over very large data sets, visualizing the results, and providing interactivity to facilitate analytical reasoning.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1703365","Data and knowledge visualization;information visualization;visual analytics;network security.","Telecommunication traffic;Data visualization;Business communication;Government;IP networks;Remote monitoring;Statistical analysis;Machine learning;Multidimensional systems;Displays","data visualisation;data warehouses;inference mechanisms;Internet;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Data and knowledge visualization;information visualization;visual analytics;network security.","Algorithms;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","11","2","19","IEEE","18 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To generate global effects, numerous approximations attempt to reduce global illumination costs to levels feasible in interactive contexts. One such approximation, reflective shadow maps, samples a shadow map to identify secondary light sources whose contributions are splatted into eye space. This splatting introduces significant overdraw that is usually reduced by artificially shrinking each splat's radius of influence. This paper introduces a new multiresolution approach for interactively splatting indirect illumination. Instead of reducing GPU fill rate by reducing splat size, we reduce fill rate by rendering splats into a multiresolution buffer. This takes advantage of the low-frequency nature of diffuse and glossy indirect lighting, allowing rendering of indirect contributions at low resolution where lighting changes slowly and at high-resolution near discontinuities. Because this multiresolution rendering occurs on a per-splat basis, we can significantly reduce fill rate without arbitrarily clipping splat contributions below a given threshold-those regions simply are rendered at a coarse resolution.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.97","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5226625","Global illumination;interactive rendering;reflective shadow maps;multiresolution splatting.","Lighting;Costs;Layout;Rendering (computer graphics);Light sources;Integral equations;Computer graphics;Optical reflection;Hemorrhaging;Geometry","light sources;rendering (computer graphics)","interactive indirect illumination;adaptive multiresolution splatting;direct illumination models;reflective shadow maps;secondary light sources;GPU fill rate;splat rendering;multiresolution buffer rendering","","11","1","40","","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By combining scalar field topology and combinatorial connectivity techniques, we present a new framework, following a coarse to fine design philosophy, which allows for explicit control of the subjective quality criteria on the output quad mesh, at interactive rates. Our quadrangulation framework uses the new notion of Reeb atlas editing, to define with a small amount of interactions a coarse quadrangulation of the model, capturing the main features of the shape, with user prescribed extraordinary vertices and alignment. Fine grain tuning is easily achieved with the notion of connectivity texturing, which allows for additional extraordinary vertices specification and explicit feature alignment, to capture the high-frequency geometries.

However, the choice of a specific data structure for a given data set depends on several factors, such as the memory budget, the sparsity of the data, and data access patterns. In general, there is no single optimal sparse data structure, but a set of several candidates with individual strengths and drawbacks. One solution to this problem are hybrid data structures which locally adapt themselves to the sparsity. However, they typically suffer from increased traversal overhead which limits their utility in many applications. This paper presents JiTTree, a novel sparse hybrid volume data structure that uses just-in-time compilation to overcome these problems. By combining multiple sparse data structures and reducing traversal overhead we leverage their individual advantages. We demonstrate that hybrid data structures adapt well to a large range of data sets. They are especially superior to other sparse data structures for data sets that locally vary in sparsity. Possible optimization criteria are memory, performance and a combination thereof. Through just-in-time (JIT) compilation, JiTTree reduces the traversal overhead of the resulting optimal data structure. As a result, our hybrid volume data structure enables efficient computations on the GPU, while being superior in terms of memory usage when compared to non-hybrid data structures.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467331","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Visual Computing Center, and the ViMaL(grant numbers:P21695); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192686","Data Transformation and Representation;GPUs and Multi-core Architectures;Volume Rendering;Data Transformation and Representation;GPUs and Multi-core Architectures;Volume Rendering","Octrees;Graphics processing units;Arrays;Memory management;Optimization;Layout","data structures;graphics processing units;just-in-time;optimisation","memory usage;traversal overhead;optimization criteria;data access patterns;memory budget;GPU memory;just-in-time compiled sparse GPU volume data structure;JiTTree","","11","","30","IEEE","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, working with human motion tracking data to support such analysis poses great challenges. In this paper, we propose MotionFlow, a visual analytics system that provides an effective overview of various motion patterns based on an interactive flow visualization. This visualization formulates a motion sequence as transitions between static poses, and aggregates these sequences into a tree diagram to construct a set of motion patterns. The system also allows the users to directly reflect the context of data and their perception of pose similarities in generating representative pose states. We provide local and global controls over the partition-based clustering process. To support the users in organizing unstructured motion data into pattern groups, we designed a set of interactions that enables searching for similar motion sequences from the data, detailed exploration of data subsets, and creating and modifying the group of motion patterns. To evaluate the usability of MotionFlow, we conducted a user study with six researchers with expertise in gesture-based interaction design. They used MotionFlow to explore and organize unstructured motion tracking data. Results show that the researchers were able to easily learn how to use MotionFlow, and the system effectively supported their pattern analysis activities, including leveraging their perception and domain knowledge.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468292","Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation(grant numbers:1235232); CPS(grant numbers:1329979); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194831","Human motion visualization;interactive clustering;motion tracking data;expert reviews;user study;Human motion visualization;interactive clustering;motion tracking data;expert reviews;user study","Data visualization;Tracking;Pattern analysis;Visualization;Context;Layout;Three-dimensional displays","data visualisation;gesture recognition;human computer interaction;interactive systems;object tracking;pattern clustering;pose estimation;trees (mathematics)","MotionFlow;visual abstraction;sequential pattern aggregation;human motion tracking data;human motion pattern analysis;visual analytics system;interactive flow visualization;motion sequence;static pose;tree diagram;pose similarity;representative pose state;partition-based clustering process;unstructured motion data organization;pattern groups;data subset exploration;gesture-based interaction design","Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Video Recording","11","3","46","IEEE","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the extracted skeleton within the treelike object, a radial planar embedding is first obtained such that there are no self-intersections of the skeleton which would have resulted in occlusions in the final view. An optimization procedure which adjusts the angular positions of the skeleton nodes is then used to reconstruct the shape as closely as possible to the original, according to a specified view plane, which thus preserves the global geometric context of the object. Using this shape recovered embedded skeleton, the object surface is then flattened to the plane without occlusions using harmonic mapping. The boundary of the mesh is adjusted during the flattening step to account for regions where the mesh is stretched over concavities. This parameterized surface can then be used either as a map for guidance during endoluminal navigation or directly for interrogation and decision making.

In contrast, the bar graph is more effective in showing the frequency/interval, but less effective in showing an overall pattern than the line graph. We integrate the line graph and bar graph in a unified visualization model, called a ripple graph, to take the benefits of both of them with enhanced graphical integrity.

Automated methods can be useful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via interactive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An inherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to truly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this limitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data space into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore these 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface while using additional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded space comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from combinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and navigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A subspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, keep their bearings, and return to interesting subspaces and views. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a word cloud of attribute labels which aid in navigation. We demonstrate our system via several use cases in a diverse set of application areas-cluster analysis and refinement, information discovery, and supervised training of classifiers.

We encode changes between neighboring cells' vLODs, which are not required to be memory resident. At the rendering time, we incrementally construct the vLOD for the current view-cell and render it. We have a small CPU and memory requirement for rendering and are able to display models with tens of millions of polygons at interactive frame rates with less than one pixel screen-space deviation and accurate visibility.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359730","Index Terms- Interactive walkthrough;levels of detail;visibility computation;compression.","Geometry;Displays;Hardware;Graphics;Military computing;Computational modeling;Solid modeling;Layout;Virtual environment;Computer Society","computational geometry;rendering (computer graphics);data visualisation;three-dimensional displays;data compression;virtual reality;solid modelling;storage management","visibility computation;data organization algorithms;high-fidelity walkthroughs;3D geometric data sets;level of detail;vLOD;rendering;screen-space deviation","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Environment;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Metamorphosis, Biological;Online Systems;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","11","14","47","IEEE","17 Jan 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns.

Previous research has suggested that people see parts of a visualization as objects, and may metaphorically interpret apparent physical relationships between these objects as suggestive of data relationships. We explored this hypothesis in detail in a series of user experiments. Inspired by the concept of implied dynamics in psychology, we first studied whether perceived gravity acting on a mark in a scatterplot can lead to errors in a participant's recall of the mark's position. The results of this study suggested that such position errors exist, but may be more strongly influenced by attraction between marks. We hypothesized that such apparent attraction may be influenced by elements used to suggest relationship between objects, such as connecting lines, grouping elements, and visual similarity. We further studied what visual elements are most likely to cause this attraction effect, and whether the elements that best predicted attraction errors were also those which suggested conceptual relationships most strongly. Our findings show a correlation between attraction errors and intuitions about relatedness, pointing towards a possible mechanism by which the perception of visual marks becomes an interpretation of data relationships.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613438","Perceptual cognition;visualization models;laboratory studies;cognition theory","Visualization;Gravity;Image color analysis;Layout;Joining processes;Data visualization;Dynamics","data visualisation;psychology;visual perception","laws of attraction;perceptual forces;conceptual similarity;information visualization;visual marks;data relationships;psychology;grouping elements;visual similarity;attraction effect;attraction errors","","10","","17","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we systematically study the extraction, representation,exploration, and visualization of spatial relations in volumetric data and propose a novel relation-aware visualization pipeline for volume exploration. In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way. The visualization process is further assisted with relation-revealing viewpoint selection and color and opacity enhancement.

Multigrid solvers show excellent convergence in simple scenarios, yet they can converge slowly in domains where physically separated regions are combined at coarser scales. Moreover, existing multigrid solvers are tailored to specific discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation, and they cannot easily be adapted to other discretizations. In this paper we analyze the convergence properties of existing multigrid solvers for the pressure Poisson equation in different simulation domains, and we show how to further improve the multigrid convergence rate by using a graph-based extension to determine the coarse grid hierarchy. The proposed multigrid solver is generic in that it can be applied to different kinds of discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation, by using solely the specification of the simulation domain and pre-assembled computational stencils. We analyze the proposed solver in combination with finite difference and finite volume discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation. Our evaluations show that, despite the common assumption, multigrid schemes can exploit their potential even in the most complicated simulation scenarios, yet this behavior is obtained at the price of higher memory consumption.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2511734","European Union; ERC(grant numbers:291372); Safer-VisâUncertainty Visualization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7364293","Fluid simulation;multigrid;convergence analysis","Mathematical model;Convergence;Computational modeling;Multigrid methods;Interpolation;Poisson equations;Topology","computational fluid dynamics;convergence of numerical methods;finite difference methods;finite volume methods;flow simulation;graph theory;Navier-Stokes equations;Poisson equation","fluid pressure Poisson equation;numerical simulations;incompressible Navier-Stokes equations;mass conservation;simulation domains;multigrid convergence rate improvement;graph-based extension;coarse grid hierarchy;generic multigrid solver;preassembled computational stencils;finite difference discretizations;finite volume discretizations","","10","","27","IEEE","23 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a method to automatically generate an OA design that closely depicts an input 3D model. Our algorithm is guided by a novel set of geometric conditions to guarantee the foldability and stability of the generated pop-ups. The generality of the conditions allows our algorithm to generate valid pop-up structures that are previously not accounted for by other algorithms. Our method takes a novel image-domain approach to convert the input model to an OA design. It performs surface segmentation of the input model in the image domain, and carefully represents each surface with a set of parallel patches. Patches are then modified to make the entire structure foldable and stable. Visual and quantitative comparisons of results have shown our algorithm to be significantly better than the existing methods in the preservation of contours, surfaces, and volume.

Although omnistereo models have been surveyed in several studies, few omnistereo sensors have actually been implemented. In this paper, a practical method for capturing omnistereo video sequences using rotating optics is proposed and evaluated. The rotating optics system consists of prism sheets, circular or linear polarizing films, and a hyperboloidal mirror.

Existing querying paradigms are based either on the usage of textual strings, for high-level semantic queries or on 2D visual examples for the expression of perceptual queries. Semantic queries require manual annotation of the database images. Instead, perceptual queries only require that image analysis is performed on the database images in order to extract salient perceptual features that are matched with those of the example. However, usage of 2D examples is generally inadequate as effective authoring of query images, attaining a realistic reproduction of complex scenes, needs manual editing and sketching ability. Investigation of new querying paradigms is therefore an important-yet still marginally investigated-factor for the success of content-based image retrieval. In this paper, a novel querying paradigm is presented which is based on usage of 3D interfaces exploiting navigation and editing of 3D virtual environments. Query images are obtained by taking a snapshot of the framed environment and by using the snapshot as an example to retrieve similar database images. A comparative analysis is carried out between the usage of 3D and 2D interfaces and their related query paradigms. This analysis develops on a user test on retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, as well as on an evaluation of users' satisfaction.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2002.1044517","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1044517","","Image databases;Spatial databases;Visual databases;Image retrieval;History;Art;Biomedical imaging;Image analysis;Feature extraction;Layout","image retrieval;content-based retrieval;user interfaces;visual databases;multimedia databases","3D user interfaces;content-based image retrieval;querying by example;image databases;perceptual queries;image analysis;perceptual features;3D virtual environment editing;3D virtual environment navigation;framed environment;snapshot;2D user interfaces;retrieval efficiency;retrieval effectiveness;user satisfaction","","10","","35","","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This process can be difficult and time consuming for professional designers, not to mention non-expert users, leading to the demand for automated infographics design. As a first step, we focus on timeline infographics, which have been widely used for centuries. We contribute an end-to-end approach that automatically extracts an extensible timeline template from a bitmap image. Our approach adopts a deconstruction and reconstruction paradigm. At the deconstruction stage, we propose a multi-task deep neural network that simultaneously parses two kinds of information from a bitmap timeline: 1) the global information, i.e., the representation, scale, layout, and orientation of the timeline, and 2) the local information, i.e., the location, category, and pixels of each visual element on the timeline. At the reconstruction stage, we propose a pipeline with three techniques, i.e., Non-Maximum Merging, Redundancy Recover, and DL GrabCut, to extract an extensible template from the infographic, by utilizing the deconstruction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesize a timeline dataset (4296 images) and collect a real-world timeline dataset (393 images) from the Internet. We first report quantitative evaluation results of our approach over the two datasets. Then, we present examples of automatically extracted templates and timelines automatically generated based on these templates to qualitatively demonstrate the performance. The results confirm that our approach can effectively extract extensible templates from real-world timeline infographics.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934810","MSRA(grant numbers:MRA19EG02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807266","Automated Infographic Design;Deep Learning-based Approach;Timeline Infographics;Multi-task Model","Visualization;Data visualization;Data mining;Image reconstruction;Pipelines;Image coding;Object detection","computer graphics;data visualisation;feature extraction;image segmentation;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","automatically extracted templates;extensible template;real-world timeline infographics;deep learning-based auto-extraction;perceptual effectiveness;visual styles;nonexpert users;automated infographics design;end-to-end approach;extensible timeline template;bitmap image;reconstruction paradigm;deconstruction stage;multitask deep neural network;bitmap timeline;global information;local information;visual element;reconstruction stage;NonMaximum Merging;real-world timeline dataset;automated infographic design","","10","","56","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finding a âgoodâ layout of a graph is thus an important task for graph visualization. In practice, users often visualize a graph in multiple layouts by using different methods and varying parameter settings until they find a layout that best suits the purpose of the visualization. However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined heuristics.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934396","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1741536); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805452","Graph;network;visualization;layout;machine learning;deep learning;neural network;generative model;autoencoder","Layout;Training;Visualization;Task analysis;Data visualization;Machine learning;Data models","data visualisation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;neural nets","graph visualization;diverse layouts;deep generative model;encoder-decoder architecture;two-dimensional latent space;graph layouts;machine learning model","","9","","87","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are currently few systematic guidelines for how to configure a successful model. This means model builders often have to experiment with different configurations by manually programming different architectures (which is tedious and time consuming) or rely on purely automated approaches to generate and train the architectures (which is expensive). In this paper, we present Rapid Exploration of Model Architectures and Parameters, or REMAP, a visual analytics tool that allows a model builder to discover a deep learning model quickly via exploration and rapid experimentation of neural network architectures. In REMAP, the user explores the large and complex parameter space for neural network architectures using a combination of global inspection and local experimentation. Through a visual overview of a set of models, the user identifies interesting clusters of architectures. Based on their findings, the user can run ablation and variation experiments to identify the effects of adding, removing, or replacing layers in a given architecture and generate new models accordingly. They can also handcraft new models using a simple graphical interface. As a result, a model builder can build deep learning models quickly, efficiently, and without manual programming. We inform the design of REMAP through a design study with four deep learning model builders. Through a use case, we demonstrate that REMAP allows users to discover performant neural network architectures efficiently using visual exploration and user-defined semi-automated searches through the model space.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934261","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:FA8750-17-2-0107); NSF(grant numbers:CAREER IIS-1452977); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827593","visual analytics;neural networks;parameter space exploration","Neural networks;Computer architecture;Tools;Training;Visual analytics;Machine learning","data analysis;data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture","graphical interface;rapid exploration of model architectures and parameters;visual analytics tool;neural network architectures;deep learning model builders;REMAP","","9","","73","IEEE","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We additionally explore whether this method can be used to compress voxel colors for off-line storage and network transmission using conventional off-line compression formats such as JPG and JPG2K.

As a framework for simplification operations, we introduce a decomposition of the data domain into regions of equivalent structural behavior and the reachability graph that describes global connectivity of Pareto extrema. Simplification is then performed as a sequence of edge collapses in this graph; to determine a suitable sequence of such operations, we describe and utilize a comparison measure that reflects the changes to the data that each operation represents.

Inspired by the powerful data modelling and prediction capabilities of deep learning techniques, we explore the possibility of applying deep learning techniques to graph drawing. Specifically, we propose using a graph-LSTM-based approach to directly map network structures to graph drawings. Given a set of layout examples as the training dataset, we train the proposed graph-LSTM-based model to capture their layout characteristics. Then, the trained model is used to generate graph drawings in a similar style for new networks. We evaluated the proposed approach on two special types of layouts (i.e., grid layouts and star layouts) and two general types of layouts (i.e., ForceAtlas2 and PivotMDS) in both qualitative and quantitative ways. The results provide support for the effectiveness of our approach. We also conducted a time cost assessment on the drawings of small graphs with 20 to 50 nodes.

Yet, such general rules cannot reflect the personal preferences of a single individual, which vary from person to person. In this paper, we intend to optimize a functional workspace according to the personal preferences of the specific individual who will use it. We come up with an approach to learn the individual's personal preferences from his activities while using a virtual version of the workspace via virtual reality devices. Then, we construct a cost function, which incorporates personal preferences, spatial constraints, pose assessments, and visual field. At last, the cost function is optimized to achieve an optimal layout. To evaluate the approach, we experimented with different settings.

Advances in genomic technologies as well as advances in computational biology have led to multiple large regulatory network models (directed networks) each with a large corpus of supporting data and gene-annotation. There are multiple possible biological motivations for exploring large regulatory network models, including: validating TF-target gene relationships, figuring out co-regulation patterns, and exploring the coordination of cell processes in response to changes in cell state or environment. Here we focus on queries aimed at validating regulatory network models, and on coordinating visualization of primary data and directed weighted gene regulatory networks. The large size of both the network models and the primary data can make such coordinated queries cumbersome with existing tools and, in particular, inhibits the sharing of results between collaborators. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a web-based framework for coordinating visualization and exploration of expression data (RNA-seq, microarray), network models and gene-binding data (ChIP-seq). Using specialized data structures and multiple coordinated views, we design an efficient querying model to support interactive analysis of the data. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our framework through case studies for the mouse immune system (a dataset focused on a subset of key cellular functions) and a model bacteria (a small genome with high data-completeness).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346753","IBM Faculty Award, the NYU School of Engineering, DOE, NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1229185,IOS-1126971); NIH(grant numbers:PN2-EY016586,IU54CA143907-01,EY016586-06); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876028","Web-based visualization;gene regulatory network","Data visualization;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Browsers;Gene expression;Data models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling","bioinformatics;cellular biophysics;genetics;genomics;graphical user interfaces;interactive systems;query processing;RNA","Genotet;interactive Web-based visual exploration framework;transcriptional regulatory network elucidation;TRN elucidation;transcription factors;gene promoter regions;gene enhancer regions;target gene expression patterns;genomic technologies;computational biology;multiple large regulatory network models;directed networks;data corpus;gene-annotation corpus;TF-target gene relationship validation;co-regulation patterns;cell process coordination;cell state;cell environment;regulatory network model validation;primary data visualization coordination;directed weighted gene regulatory networks;network models;primary data;coordinated queries;expression data exploration coordination;expression data visualization coordination;RNA- seq;microarray;gene-binding data;ChIP-seq;specialized data structures;multiple coordinated views;querying model;interactive analysis;mouse immune system;cellular functions;bacteria model;genome;data-completeness","Animals;Computational Biology;Computer Graphics;Databases, Genetic;Gene Regulatory Networks;Internet;Mice;Transcription Factors;User-Computer Interface","9","","32","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our preference model uses Bayesian classification to tag elements in a data set as interesting or not interesting to the viewer. The model responds in real time, updating the elements of interest based on a viewer's actions. This allows us to track a viewer's interests as they change during exploration and analysis. Viewers can also interact directly with interest rules the preference model defines.

The image composition step is a notorious bottleneck in a clustered rendering system. Furthermore, image compositing algorithms do not necessarily scale as data size and number of nodes increase. Previous researchers have addressed the composition problem via software and/or custom-built hardware. We used the heterogeneous multicore computation architecture of the Intel IXP28XX NPU, a fully programmable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology, to perform the image composition step. With this design, we have attained a nearly four-times performance increase over traditional software-based compositing methods, achieving sustained compositing rates of 22-28 fps on a 1,024 \times 1,024 image. This system is fully scalable with a negligible penalty in frame rate, is entirely COTS, and is flexible with regard to operating system, rendering software, graphics cards, and node architecture. The NPU-based compositor has the additional advantage of being a modular compositing component that is eminently suitable for integration into existing distributed software visualization packages.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.1026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293022","Hardware-assisted image compositing;high-performance computing;image compositing;Network Processing Unit;parallel rendering;PC clusters;visualization;volume rendering.","Rendering (computer graphics);Computer architecture;Data visualization;Clustering algorithms;Hardware;Multicore processing;Operating systems;Software systems;Graphics;Software packages","computer graphic equipment;data visualisation;distributed processing;image processing;rendering (computer graphics);software packages","distributed visualization system;network processing unit;hardware-based image composition;distributed rendering system;clustered rendering system;Intel IXP28XX NPU;commercial off-the-shelf technology;operating system;rendering software;graphics cards;node architecture;distributed software visualization packages","Algorithms;Computer Communication Networks;Computer Graphics;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","9","","34","USGov","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, information in this area has yet to be fully excavated. Thus, we present PieceStack in this paper, to reveal the relevance of stacked graphs in understanding intrinsic details of their displayed shapes. This new visual analytic design interprets the ways through which aggregations are generated with individual layers by interactively splitting and re-constructing the stacked graphs. A clustering algorithm is designed to partition stacked graphs into sub-aggregated pieces based on trend similarities of layers. We then visualize the pieces with augmented encoding to help analysts decompose and explore the graphs with respect to their interests.

Without careful attention, and if PWD are not included as equal participants throughout the process, there is a danger of perpetuating a vision-first approach to accessible design that marginalizes the lived experience of disability (e.g., by creating overly simplistic ""sensory translations"" that map visual to non-visual modalities in a one-to-one fashion). In this paper, we present a set of sociotechnical considerations for research in accessible visualization design, drawing on literature in disability studies, tactile information systems, and participatory methods. We identify that using state-of-the-art technologies may introduce more barriers to access than they remove, and that expectations of research novelty may not produce outcomes well-aligned with the needs of disability communities. Instead, to promote a more inclusive design process, we emphasize the importance of clearly communicating goals, following existing accessibility guidelines, and treating PWD as equal participants who are compensated for their specialized skills. To illustrate how these considerations can be applied in practice, we discuss a case study of an inclusive design workshop held in collaboration with the Perkins School for the Blind.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933762","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization design and evaluation methods;Accessibility;Accessibility technologies","Biological system modeling;Visualization;Guidelines;Data visualization;Medical diagnostic imaging;Human computer interaction","data visualisation;handicapped aids;human computer interaction;user interfaces","PWD;visualization research community;nonvisual modalities;sociotechnical considerations;accessible visualization design;disability communities;inclusive design workshop;people with disabilities","","9","","44","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing visualization approaches for such data include animated 2D treemaps, where the dynamically changing layout makes it difficult to observe the data in its entirety. We present a method to visualize this dynamic data in a static, nested, and space-filling visualization. This is based on two major contributions: First, the layout constitutes a graph drawing problem. We approach it for the entire time span at once using a combination of a heuristic and simulated annealing. Second, we propose a rendering that emphasizes the hierarchy through an adaption of the classic cushion treemaps.

In the past, many classes of graphs have been defined, e.g. trees, planar graphs, directed acyclic graphs, and visualization algorithms were proposed for these classes. Although many graphs may only be classified as ""general"" graphs, they can contain substructures that belong to a certain class. Archambault proposed the TopoLayout framework: rather than draw any arbitrary graph using one method, split the graph into components that are homogeneous with respect to one graph class and then draw each component with an algorithm best suited for this class. Graph products constitute a class that arises frequently in graph theory, but for which no visualization algorithm has been proposed until now. In this paper, we present an algorithm for drawing graph products and the aesthetic criterion graph product's drawings are subject to. We show that the popular High-Dimensional Embedder approach applied to cartesian products already respects this aestetic criterion, but has disadvantages. We also present how our method is integrated as a new component into the TopoLayout framework.

In this work, we present a novel technique to visualize the action of a kernel, that is, how the kernel embeds data into a high-dimensional feature space.

In scalar field topology, graph-based topological descriptors such as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are commonly used to characterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields. One of the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based visualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such topological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In this paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and use it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree that minimizes its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a well-defined metric called the interleaving distance. We provide heuristic strategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose labels do not fully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that resembles a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and outputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural similarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty information for visual exploration. We develop a novel measure of uncertainty, referred to as consistency, via a metric-space view of the input trees. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our framework through merge trees that arise from ensembles of scalar fields. Our work is the first to employ interleaving distances and consistency to study a global, mathematically rigorous, structural average of merge trees in the context of uncertainty visualization.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934242","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1740761,CCF-1907591,CMMI-1562012,DBI-1661375,IIS-1513616,RI-1815697,DMS-1547357); NIH(grant numbers:R01EB022899,1R01EB022876); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794553","Topological data analysis;uncertainty visualization;merge trees","Uncertainty;Data visualization;Vegetation;Topology;Visualization;Measurement uncertainty","computational geometry;data analysis;data visualisation;interactive systems;trees (mathematics)","structural average;labeled merge trees;uncertainty visualization;scalar field topology;graph-based topological descriptors;topology-based visualization;1-center tree;interleaving distance;interactive visualization system;topological data analysis;topological data visualization","","8","","81","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability. Requirements for analysis and initial research questions to be investigated are elicited from domain experts, and a variety of visual encoding techniques for rapid assessment of analysis and correlations between trade goods, network patterns, and time series signatures are explored. We demonstrate the application of our framework through case studies focusing on armed conflicts in Africa, regional instability measures, and their relationship to international global trade.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864844","U.S. Department of Homeland Security(grant numbers:2017-ST-061-QA0001); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1350573,1639227); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440040","Global trade network;anomaly detection;visual analytics","Data visualization;Visual analytics;Correlation;Anomaly detection;Time series analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena","data analysis;data visualisation;economics;financial data processing;globalisation;international trade;time series","regional instability measures;international global trade;visual analytics framework;spatiotemporal trade network analysis;economic globalization;supply chains;supply shocks;network-induced vulnerability;political science;environmental studies;global trade networks;multivariate nature;spatiotemporal nature;network structure;exploratory data analysis;multiview framework;network analytics;spatiotemporal visualization methods;visual encoding techniques;trade goods","","8","","82","IEEE","19 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Not only are other encodings less precise than position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). By comparison, position's high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. In contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a short delay. In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of average positions were significantly biased, such that line positions were underestimated and bar positions were overestimated. In displays with multiple data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias still persisted. We also observed an effect of âperceptual pullâ, where the average position estimate for each series was `pulled' toward the other. These findings suggest that, although position may still be the most precise form of visual data encoding, it can also be systematically biased.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805427","Perceptual biases;perception and cognition;cue combination;bar graphs;line graphs;position estimation","Bars;Data visualization;Visualization;Encoding;Systematics;Image color analysis;Task analysis","data visualisation;estimation theory;graph theory;image colour analysis","multiple data series;systematic bias;perceptual pull;visual data encoding;bar graphs;overestimation;color category boundaries;line positions;bar positions;biased average position estimation","","8","","34","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Highly multiplexed tissue images are complex, comprising 109 or more pixels, 60-plus channels, and millions of individual cells. This makes manual analysis challenging and error-prone. Existing automated approaches are also inadequate, in large part, because they are unable to effectively exploit the deep knowledge of human tissue biology available to anatomic pathologists. To overcome these challenges, Facetto enables a semi-automated analysis of cell types and states. It integrates unsupervised and supervised learning into the image and feature exploration process and offers tools for analytical provenance. Experts can cluster the data to discover new types of cancer and immune cells and use clustering results to train a convolutional neural network that classifies new cells accordingly. Likewise, the output of classifiers can be clustered to discover aggregate patterns and phenotype subsets. We also introduce a new hierarchical approach to keep track of analysis steps and data subsets created by users; this assists in the identification of cell types. Users can build phenotype trees and interact with the resulting hierarchical structures of both high-dimensional feature and image spaces.

In this article, we propose a brand-new solution to this cross-domain expression transfer problem via nonlinear expression embedding and expression domain translation. We first build low-dimensional latent spaces for the human and avatar facial expressions with variational autoencoder. Then we construct correspondences between the two latent spaces guided by geometric and perceptual constraints. Specifically, we design geometric correspondences to reflect geometric matching and utilize a triplet data structure to express usersâ perceptual preference of avatar expressions. A user-friendly method is proposed to automatically generate triplets for a system allowing users to easily and efficiently annotate the correspondences. Using both geometric and perceptual correspondences, we trained a network for expression domain translation from human to avatar.

To resolve this problem, we propose a novel deep neural network, View Discerning Network, which learns to judge the quality of views and adjust their contributions to the representation of shapes. In this network, a Score Generation Unit is devised to evaluate the quality of each projected image with score vectors. These score vectors are used to weight the image features and the weighted features perform much better than original features in 3D shape recognition task. In particular, we introduce two structures of Score Generation Unit, Channel-wise Score Unit and Part-wise Score Unit, to assess the quality of feature maps from different perspectives. Our network aggregates features and scores in an end-to-end framework, so that final shape descriptors are directly obtained from its output.

The retexturing results have the similar distortion and shading effect conforming to the unknown underlying geometry and lighting conditions. For replacing textures in a single image, two important steps are developed: The stretch-based mesh parameterization incorporating the recovered normal information is deduced to imitate perspective distortion of the region of interest; the Poisson-based refinement process is exploited to account for texture distortion at fine scale. The luminance of the input image is preserved through color transfer in YCbCr color space. Our approach is independent of the replaced textures. Once the input image is processed, any new textures can be applied to efficiently generate the retexturing results. For video retexturing, we propose key-frame-based texture replacement extended and generalized from the image retexturing. Our approach repeatedly propagates the replacement results of key frames to the rest of the frames. We develop the local motion optimization scheme to deal with the inaccuracies and errors of robust optical flow when tracking moving objects. Visibility shifting and texture drifting are effectively alleviated using graphcut segmentation algorithm and the global optimization to smooth trajectories of the tracked points over temporal domain.

However, the design of storyline visualizations is a difficult task as users need to balance between aesthetic goals and narrative constraints. Despite that the optimization-based methods have been improved significantly in terms of producing aesthetic and legible layouts, the existing (semi-) automatic methods are still limited regarding 1) efficient exploration of the storyline design space and 2) flexible customization of storyline layouts. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines. We evaluate the reinforcement learning model through qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate the usage of PlotThread using a collection of use cases.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030467","Joint Sino-German program of NSFC(grant numbers:61761136020); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1004300); NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization(grant numbers:U1609217); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:LR18F020001); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:LR18F020001); Microsoft Research Asia; XJTLU Research Development Funding(grant numbers:RDF-19-02-11); German Science Foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:392087235); Sino-German program of NSFC(grant numbers:(61761136020)); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:(2018YFB 1004300)); NSFC-Zhejiang Joint Fund for the Integration of Industrialization and Informatization(grant numbers:(U1609217)); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:(LR18F020001)); Talents Program of Zhejiang University.

Vector-based scaling reduces distortion to components, but distorts layout. We present several strategies to reduce this distortion by using the structure of the topology, including orthogonality and alignment, and a model of user intention to foster smooth and predictable navigation. We evaluate this approach through two user studies: Results show that (1) SchemeLens is 16-27% faster than both round and rectangular flat-top fisheye lenses at finding and identifying a target along one or several paths in a network diagram; (2) augmenting SchemeLens with a model of user intentions aids in learning the network topology.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467035","French ANR/Investissement dâ Avenir âCluster Connexion.â; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192681","Fisheye;vector-scaling;content-aware;network schematics;interactive zoom;navigation;information visualization;Fisheye;vector-scaling;content-aware;network schematics;interactive zoom;navigation;information visualization","Lenses;Distortion;Navigation;Visualization;Context;Layout;Shape","data visualisation;distortion;lenses;topology;vectors","SchemeLens;content-aware vector-based fisheye technique;large systems diagrams navigation;system schematics;electrical systems;hydraulic systems;large documents navigation;focus region;diagram readability;topology-aware fisheye technique;vector-based scaling;components distortion;layout distortion;topology structure;topology orthogonality;topology alignment;user intention;network diagram;information visualization","","8","","33","IEEE","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent work has shown that visualizations are a powerful tool to aid debugging, analyzing, and interpreting ML models. However, depending on the complexity of the model (e.g., number of features), interpreting these visualizations can be difficult and may require additional expertise. Alternatively, textual descriptions, or verbalizations, can be a simple, yet effective way to communicate or summarize key aspects about a model, such as the overall trend in a model's predictions or comparisons between pairs of data instances. With the potential benefits of visualizations and verbalizations in mind, we explore how the two can be combined to aid ML interpretability. Specifically, we present a prototype system, TeleGam, that demonstrates how visualizations and verbalizations can collectively support interactive exploration of ML models, for example, generalized additive models (GAMs). We describe TELEGAM's interface and underlying heuristics to generate the verbalizations. We conclude by discussing how TeleGam can serve as a platform to conduct future studies for understanding user expectations and designing novel interfaces for interpretable ML.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933695","Human-centered computing;Visual Analytics","Data models;Data visualization;Predictive models;Analytical models;Shape;Natural languages;Additives","data visualisation;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;user interfaces","TeleGam;visualization;verbalization;interpretable machine learning;hard problems;ML models;verbalizations;ML interpretability;interactive exploration;generalized additive models;heuristics;interpretable ML","","8","","41","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel visual summarization technique for bipartite graphs based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The method simultaneously groups the two different set of nodes and constructs aggregated bipartite relations with balanced granularity and precision. It addresses the key trade-off that often occurs for visualizing large scale and noisy data: acquiring a clear and uncluttered overview while maximizing the information content in it. We formulate the visual summarization task as a co-clustering problem and propose an efficient algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that can easily scale to large graphs under reasonable interactive time constraints that previous related methods cannot satisfy. The method leads to the opportunity of introducing a visual analytics framework with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration. In the framework, we also introduce a compact visual design inspired by adjacency list representation of graphs as the building block for a small multiples display to compare the bipartite relations for different subsets of data. We showcase the applicability and effectiveness of our approach by applying it on synthetic data with ground truth and performing case studies on real-world datasets from two application domains including roll-call vote record analysis and vehicle fault pattern analysis.

In this article, we investigate the use of such architectures for learning the upscaling of a low resolution sampling of an isosurface to a higher resolution, with reconstruction of spatial detail and shading. We introduce a fully convolutional neural network, to learn a latent representation generating smooth, edge-aware depth and normal fields as well as ambient occlusions from a low resolution depth and normal field. By adding a frame-to-frame motion loss into the learning stage, upscaling can consider temporal variations and achieves improved frame-to-frame coherence. We assess the quality of inferred results and compare it to bi-linear and cubic upscaling. We do this for isosurfaces which were never seen during training, and investigate the improvements when the network can train on the same or similar isosurfaces.

This replaces the default display behavior of repeating application frames until an update is available. We will show three benefits of the architecture typical to VR. First, smooth motion is provided by generating intermediate display frames by per-pixel depth-image warping using 3D motion fields. Smooth motion eliminates various perceptual artifacts due to judder. Second, we implement fine-grained latency reduction at the display frame level using a synchronized prediction of simulation objects and the viewpoint. This improves the average quality and consistency of latency reduction. Third, a crosstalk reduction algorithm for consecutive display frames is implemented, which improves the quality of stereoscopic images.

Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space. We build a new dataset containing 360 images of MVs collected from IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and PacificVis publications 2011 to 2019, and make fine-grained annotations of view types and layouts for these visualization images.

In this paper, a new graph sampling method is proposed oriented to the preservation of contextual structures. We first utilize a graph representation learning (GRL) model to transform nodes into vectors so that the contextual structures in a network can be effectively extracted and organized. Then, we propose a multi-objective blue noise sampling model to select a subset of nodes in the vectorized space to preserve contextual structures with the retention of relative data and cluster densities in addition to those features of significance, such as bridging nodes and graph connections. We also design a set of visual interfaces enabling users to interactively conduct context-aware sampling, visually compare results with various sampling strategies, and deeply explore large networks.

We ran experiments to evaluate how gaze estimates from our method compare with eye-tracking data. First, we evaluated crowdsourced estimates for three common types of information visualizations and basic visualization tasks using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). In another, we reproduced findings from a previous eye-tracking study on tree layouts using our method on MTurk. Results from these experiments show that fixation estimates using Fauxvea are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to eye tracking on the same stimulus-task pairs.

Then, we propose a predictive parallel strategy to overcome the network latency for client-server-based view-dependent multiresolution rendering systems. Our solution is to make the client process and the server process run in parallel using the rendering time to cover the network latency. For networks with long round-trip times, we manage to overlap the network latency for one frame with the rendering time for multiple frames. View parameter prediction is incorporated to make the parallelism of the client and the server feasible. In order to maintain an acceptable view-dependent rendering quality in the network environment, we develop a synchronization mechanism and a dynamic adjustment mechanism to handle the transient network slowdowns and the changes in the network condition.

In this work, we introduce LassoNet, a new deep neural network for lasso selection of 3D point clouds, attempting to learn a latent mapping from viewpoint and lasso to point cloud regions. To achieve this, we couple user-target points with viewpoint and lasso information through 3D coordinate transform and naive selection, and improve the method scalability via an intention filtering and farthest point sampling. A hierarchical network is trained using a dataset with over 30K lasso-selection records on two different point cloud data.

Spatially-sparse convolution, taking advantage of the intrinsic sparsity of 3D point cloud data, makes high resolution 3D convolutional neural networks tractable with state-of-the-art results on 3D semantic segmentation problems. However, the exhaustive computations limits the practical usage of semantic 3D perception for VR/AR applications in portable devices. In this paper, we identify that the efficiency bottleneck lies in the unorganized memory access of the sparse convolution steps, i.e., the points are stored independently based on a predefined dictionary, which is inefficient due to the limited memory bandwidth of parallel computing devices (GPU). With the insight that points are continuous as 2D surfaces in 3D space, a chunk-based sparse convolution scheme is proposed to reuse the neighboring points within each spatially organized chunk. An efficient multi-layer adaptive fusion module is further proposed for employing the spatial consistency cue of 3D data to further reduce the computational burden. Quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach works 11Ã faster than previous approaches with competitive accuracy.

Since subtle changes of a fabric's microstructures can greatly affect its macroscopic appearance, mechanics-driven appearance variation of fabrics has been a phenomenon that remains to be captured. We introduce a mechanics-aware model that adapts the microstructures of cloth yarns in a physics-based manner. Our technique works on two distinct physical scales: using physics-based simulations of individual yarns, we capture the rearrangement of yarn-level structures in response to external forces. These yarn structures are further enriched to obtain appearance-driving fiber-level details. The cross-scale enrichment is made practical through a new parameter fitting algorithm for simulation, an augmented procedural yarn model coupled with a custom-design regression neural network. We train the network using a dataset generated by joint simulations at both the yarn and the fiber levels.

However, no edge concentration method with the explicit purpose of minimizing the number of edges has previously been studied. In this study, we propose a novel, efficient heuristic method for minimizing the number of edges during edge concentration. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method via a comparison using randomly generated graphs.

Previous works of this topic consider pure static scenes, but in this paper, we focus on more challenging cases that the scene contains dynamic objects, for example, moving people and floating curtains, which are quite common in reality and thus are eagerly required to be handled. We develop an end-to-end system using a depth sensor to scan a scene on the fly. By proposing a Sigmoid-based Iterative Closest Point (S-ICP) method, we decouple the camera motion and the scene motion from the input sequence and segment the scene into static and dynamic parts accordingly. The static part is used to estimate the camera rigid motion, while for the dynamic part, graph node-based motion representation and model-to-depth fitting are applied to reconstruct the scene motions. With the camera and scene motions reconstructed, we further propose a novel mixed voxel allocation scheme to handle static and dynamic scene parts with different mechanisms, which helps to gradually fuse a large scene with both static and dynamic objects. Experiments show that our technique successfully fuses the geometry of both the static and dynamic objects in a scene in real time, which extends the usage of the current techniques for indoor scene reconstruction.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2786233","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671268,61727808); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8241434","Scene reconstruction;dynamic reconstruction;single view","Dynamics;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Real-time systems;Image reconstruction;Geometry;Solid modeling","cameras;computer vision;graph theory;image fusion;image reconstruction;image representation;image segmentation;image sensors;image sequences;iterative methods;motion estimation;stereo image processing","dynamic objects;scene motion;static scene parts;dynamic scene parts;static objects;real-time reconstruction;real-time indoor scene reconstruction;3D geometry recovery;moving people;floating curtains;depth sensor;scene scanning;sigmoid-based iterative closest point method;camera motion;scene segmentation;camera rigid motion estimation;graph node-based motion representation;model-to-depth fitting;mixed voxel allocation;MixedFusion","","7","","30","IEEE","28 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike other machine learning applications such as image recognition, where different inputs have a uniform and consistent format (e.g., an array of all the pixels in an image), the input for deformable simulation is quite variable, high-dimensional, and parametrization-unfriendly. Consequently, even though the neural network is known for its rich expressivity of nonlinear functions, directly using an NN to reconstruct the force-displacement relation for general deformable simulation is nearly impossible. NNWarp obviates this difficulty by partially restoring the force-displacement relation via warping the nodal displacement simulated using a simplistic constitutive model-the linear elasticity. In other words, NNWarp yields an incremental displacement fix per mesh node based on a simplified (therefore incorrect) simulation result other than synthesizing the unknown displacement directly. We introduce a compact yet effective feature vector including geodesic, potential and digression to sort training pairs of per-node linear and nonlinear displacement. NNWarp is robust under different model shapes and tessellations. With the assistance of deformation substructuring, one NN training is able to handle a wide range of 3D models of various geometries. Thanks to the linear elasticity and its constant system matrix, the underlying simulator only needs to perform one pre-factorized matrix solve at each time step, which allows NNWarp to simulate large models in real time.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2881451","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CHS-1717972); AFRL(grant numbers:FA9453-18-2-0022); NSFC(grant numbers:61772462,U1736217); Microsoft Research Asia; NSFC(grant numbers:61732016); Alibaba IDEA Lab; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2017YFB1002600); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CHS-1524992); NSFC(grant numbers:61772024,61732016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536417","Neural network;machine learning;data-driven animation;nonlinear regression;deformable model;physics-based simulation","Artificial neural networks;Deformable models;Strain;Computational modeling;Animation;Elasticity","deformation;elasticity;mechanical engineering computing;mesh generation;neural nets;solid modelling","linear elasticity;digression feature vector;potential feature vector;geodesic feature vector;effective feature vector;compact feature vector;incremental displacement fix per mesh node;deformable simulation;highly re-usable and efficient neural network;NNWarp;highly reusable network;deformation substructuring;nodal displacement;force-displacement relation;nonlinear deformable simulation framework;neural network-based nonlinear deformation","","7","","85","IEEE","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite of significant advancement in recent years, the existing methods still suffer from two issues: 1) they are either designed without preserving sharp features or less robust in feature preservation; and 2) they usually have many parameters and require tedious parameter tuning. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning approach that automatically and robustly filters point clouds by removing noise and preserving their sharp features. Our point-wise learning architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder directly takes points (a point and its neighbors) as input, and learns a latent representation vector which goes through the decoder to relate the ground-truth position with a displacement vector. The trained neural network can automatically generate a set of clean points from a noisy input. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in terms of both visual quality and quantitative error metrics.

Hence, existing such systems are described mainly from a technological point of view; their conceptual description is usually limited to the description of a scenario that is implementable with or circumvents the limitations of the chosen technology. This focus on technology makes it difficult to compare systems' concepts; moreover, it has led to different views on tele-immersion in different fields, such as remotely controlled robots, immersive video conferencing, and tele-collaboration. In this work, we give a general, structured principle to describe the conceptual part of any tele-immersion system. This principle naturally unifies the different views on tele-immersion. Our idea is based on the insight that, in order to be general, immersion must be described separately for each direction of communication. We characterize communication between locations using a graph; for each directed edge of this graph, we describe immersion as operations on volumes. Using this principle, we define a typology, which enables the comparison and enumeration of tele-immersion concepts. We apply this typology to survey the concepts of existing tele-immersion systems and thereby demonstrate how three well-known tele-immersive scenarios-Marvin Minsky's tele-operated robot, the Office of the Future, and the asymmetric Beaming scenario-integrate naturally. We show how the general principle can be utilized conveniently to grasp conceptual ideas in tele-immersion, such as direct interaction, locational presence, spatial consistency, symmetries, and self-inclusion.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2767590","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8093688","Tele-immersion;telepresence;immersive tele-collaboration;virtual reality;augmented reality;mixed reality;communication notation;immersive extent;joint social attention","Avatars;Communication channels;Real-time systems;Robot sensing systems","directed graphs;telerobotics","tele-immersion concepts;tele-immersive systems development;immersive video conferencing;tele-collaboration;tele-immersion system;immersive technology;Marvin Minsky's tele-operated robot;directed edge;asymmetric Beaming scenario","","7","","56","IEEE","1 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A physically inspired evolution process based on a modified heat equation is used to create an improved layout density image, making better use of available screen space. Using results from optimal mass transport problems, a warp to the improved density image is computed. The graph nodes are displaced according to the warp. The warp maintains the overall structure of the graph, thus limiting disturbances to the mental map, while reducing the clutter in dense areas of the layout. The complexity of the algorithm depends mainly on the resolution of the image visualizing the graph and is linear in the size of the graph. This allows scaling the computation according to required running times. It is demonstrated how the algorithm can be significantly accelerated using a graphics processing unit (GPU), resulting in the ability to handle large graphs in a matter of seconds.

These techniques generally display aggregate statistics computed over sets of event sequences that share common patterns. Such techniques are often hindered, however, by the high-dimensionality of many real-world event sequence datasets which can prevent effective aggregation. A common coping strategy for this challenge is to group event types together prior to visualization, as a pre-process, so that each group can be represented within an analysis as a single event type. However, computing these event groupings as a pre-process also places significant constraints on the analysis. This paper presents a new visual analytics approach for dynamic hierarchical dimension aggregation. The approach leverages a predefined hierarchy of dimensions to computationally quantify the informativeness, with respect to a measure of interest, of alternative levels of grouping within the hierarchy at runtime. This information is then interactively visualized, enabling users to dynamically explore the hierarchy to select the most appropriate level of grouping to use at any individual step within an analysis. Key contributions include an algorithm for interactively determining the most informative set of event groupings for a specific analysis context, and a scented scatter-plus-focus visualization design with an optimization-based layout algorithm that supports interactive hierarchical exploration of alternative event type groupings. We apply these techniques to high-dimensional event sequence data from the medical domain and report findings from domain expert interviews.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934661","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1704018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807220","Temporal event sequence visualization;visual analytics;hierarchical aggregation;medical informatics","Data visualization;Visual analytics;Runtime;Sequences;Layout;Navigation","data aggregation;data analysis;data visualisation","dynamic hierarchical aggregation;temporal event data;visual analysis;high-dimensional event sequence data;alternative event type groupings;scented scatter-plus-focus visualization design;dynamic hierarchical dimension aggregation;event groupings;single event type;group event types;real-world event sequence datasets;visual analytics techniques","","7","","60","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The success of existing methods is generally built upon large scale data annotated with 3D human joints. However, it is a labor-intensive and error-prone process to annotate 3D human joints from input depth images or point clouds, due to the self-occlusion between body parts as well as the tedious annotation process on 3D point clouds. Meanwhile, it is easier to construct human pose datasets with 2D human joint annotations on depth images. To address this problem, we present a weakly supervised adversarial learning framework for 3D human pose estimation from point clouds. Compared to existing 3D human pose estimation methods from depth images or point clouds, we exploit both the weakly supervised data with only annotations of 2D human joints and fully supervised data with annotations of 3D human joints. In order to relieve the human pose ambiguity due to weak supervision, we adopt adversarial learning to ensure the recovered human pose is valid. Instead of using either 2D or 3D representations of depth images in previous methods, we exploit both point clouds and the input depth image. We adopt 2D CNN to extract 2D human joints from the input depth image, 2D human joints aid us in obtaining the initial 3D human joints and selecting effective sampling points that could reduce the computation cost of 3D human pose regression using point clouds network. The used point clouds network can narrow down the domain gap between the network input i.e. point clouds and 3D joints. Thanks to weakly supervised adversarial learning framework, our method can achieve accurate 3D human pose from point clouds.

Our contributions are threefold. First, we show that choosing transitions based on relevant features significantly reduces graph construction time and leads to improved search performances. Second, we employ a fast channel search method that confines the motion graph search to a free channel with guaranteed clearance among obstacles, achieving faster and improved results that avoid expensive collision checking. Lastly, we present a motion deformation model based on Inverse Kinematics applied over the transitions of a solution branch. Each transition is assigned a continuous deformation range that does not exceed the original transition cost threshold specified by the user for the graph construction. The obtained deformation improves the reachability of the feature-based motion graph and in turn also reduces the time spent during search.

The key is to compare and analyze the datapaths of both the adversarial and normal examples. A datapath is a group of critical neurons along with their connections. We formulate the datapath extraction as a subset selection problem and solve it by constructing and training a neural network. A multi-level visualization consisting of a network-level visualization of data flows, a layer-level visualization of feature maps, and a neuron-level visualization of learned features, has been designed to help investigate how datapaths of adversarial and normal examples diverge and merge in the prediction process.

The many possible navigation scenarios, as well as the interplay between signs and human navigation, can make the manual design process overwhelming and non-trivial. As a result, creating a wayfinding design for a typical layout can take months to several years. In this paper, we introduce the Way to Go! approach for automatically generating a wayfinding design for a given layout. The designer simply has to specify some navigation scenarios; our approach will automatically generate an optimized wayfinding design with signs properly placed considering human agents' visibility and possibility of making mistakes during a navigation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating wayfinding designs for different layouts such as a train station, a downtown and a canyon. We evaluate our results by comparing different wayfinding designs and show that our optimized wayfinding design can guide pedestrians to their destinations effectively and efficiently.

The increasing size of CNN models, however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss. Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical threshold of the pruning criteria, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner. It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning plans. Through comprehensive case studies on CNNs with real-world sizes, we validate the effectiveness of CNNPruner.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030461","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA19080102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222510","visualization;model pruning;convolutional neural network;explainable artificial intelligence","Computational modeling;Numerical models;Analytical models;Visual analytics;Predictive models;Deep learning","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;data analysis;data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing","neuron pruning;visual analytics approach;convolutional filters;pruning plans;CNNs;convolutional neural networks;computer vision tasks;CNN models;pruned networks;pruning criteria;filter visualization techniques;CNNPruner","Computer Graphics;Neural Networks, Computer;Neurons","6","","46","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike other algorithms generating circular drawings, our algorithm does not require the quotient graph to be acyclic, nor does it sacrifice the edge crossing number of individual clusters to improve respective positioning of the clusters. Moreover, it reduces the total area required by a cluster by using the space inside the associated circle. Experimental results show that the execution time and quality of the produced drawings with respect to commonly accepted layout criteria are quite satisfactory, surpassing previous algorithms.

These methods manipulate the whole process directly in the field of RGB space, which unavoidably results in unsmooth noises at patch boundaries. If denoising methods are used, the sketch edges would be blurred and face structures could not be restored. Recent researches of feature maps, which are the outputs of a certain neural network layer, have achieved great success in texture synthesis and artistic image generation. In this paper, we reformulate the face sketch synthesis problem into a neural network feature maps based optimization task. Our results accurately capture the sketch drawing style and make full use of the whole stylistic information hidden in the training dataset.

Existing visualization systems and approaches, however, often make an explicit trade-off between either affording rich exploration of individual data units and their attributes or exploration of the underlying network structure. In doing so, important analysis opportunities and insights are potentially missed. In this study, we aim to address this gap by (1) considering visualizations and interaction techniques that blend the spectrum between unit and network visualizations, (2) discussing the nature of different forms of contexts and the challenges in implementing them, and (3) demonstrating the value of our approach for visual exploration of multivariate, relational data for a real-world use case. Specifically, we demonstrate through a system called Graphicle how network structure can be layered on top of unit visualization techniques to create new opportunities for visual exploration of physician characteristics and referral data.

However, today's tools do not suffice to characterize the complex relationships between these factors. Further, they require advanced expertise to be used effectively. We present MemAxes, a tool based on a novel approach for analytic-driven visualization of memory performance data.

We define mappings of sampled memory access data to new and existing visual metaphors, each of which enabling a user to perform different analysis tasks. We present methods to guide user interaction by scoring subsets of the data based on known performance problems.

The training is end-to-end and does not require any saliency ground truth but only the class membership of meshes. Our Classification-for-Saliency CNN (CfS-CNN) employs a multi-view setup and contains a newly designed two-channel structure which integrates view-based features of both classification and saliency. It essentially transfers knowledge from 3D object classification to mesh saliency. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods according to extensive experimental results. Also, the CfS-CNN can be directly used for scene saliency.

Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data visualizations. Quantitative evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030423","Microsoft Research Asia(grant numbers:MRA19EG02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229072","Mobile visualization;Responsive visualization;Machine learning for visualizations;Reinforcement learning","Data visualization;Visualization;Mobile handsets;Sociology;Statistics;Encoding;Layout","data visualisation;decision theory;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;mobile computing;mobile handsets;optimisation","web visualizations;mobile phones;explainable reinforcement learning framework;mobile devices;frustrating user experience;tedious time-consuming process;designs scale;libraries;diagnosing;repairing issues;mobile-friendly visualization re-design process;reinforcement learning framework;SVG-based visualizations;common mobile-friendly issues;single-view Cartesian visualizations;Markov Decision Process model;MobileVisFixer;data visualizations","","6","","78","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Commonly, a mesh surface is reconstructed from the point cloud and a high-resolution texture is generated over the mesh from the images taken at the site to represent surface materials. However, this global reconstruction and texturing approach becomes impractical with increasing data sizes. Recently, due to its potential for scalability and extensibility, a method for texturing a set of depth maps in a preprocessing and stitching them at runtime has been proposed to represent large scenes. However, the rendering performance of this method is strongly dependent on the number of depth maps and their resolution. Moreover, for the proposed scene representation, every single depth map has to be textured by the images, which in practice heavily increases processing costs. In this paper, we present a novel method to break these dependencies by introducing an efficient raytracing of multiple depth maps. In a preprocessing phase, we first generate high-resolution textured depth maps by rendering the input points from image cameras and then perform a graph-cut based optimization to assign a small subset of these points to the images. At runtime, we use the resulting point-to-image assignments (1) to identify for each view ray which depth map contains the closest ray-surface intersection and (2) to efficiently compute this intersection point. The resulting algorithm accelerates both the texturing and the rendering of the depth maps by an order of magnitude.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2430333","Austrian Research Promotion Agency(grant numbers:835948); EU FP7 project HARVEST4D(grant numbers:323567); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7102754","Point-based rendering;raytracing depth maps;large-scale models;Point-based rendering;raytracing depth maps;large-scale models","Rendering (computer graphics);Labeling;Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Surface texture;Surface reconstruction;Runtime","cameras;data visualisation;graph theory;image reconstruction;image resolution;image texture;mesh generation;optimisation;ray tracing;rendering (computer graphics)","multidepth-map raytracing;large-scene reconstruction;high-quality visualization;mesh surface;high-resolution texture;image texture;image representation;surface material representation;rendering performance;high-resolution textured depth map;graph-cut based optimization;closest ray-surface intersection","","6","","19","IEEE","6 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approximation is used to compute a good starting point for the iteration, which ensures rapid convergence. Trimming curves are described by a tree of trimming primitives, such as squares, circles, polygons, and free-form curves, combined with Boolean operations. For trimmed surfaces, an irregular adaptive subdivision is constructed to quickly eliminate all parts outside the trimming curve from consideration during rendering.

Such lenses, usually called âvolumetric lenses,â are an extension of 2D Magic Lenses to 3D volumes in which effects are applied to scene elements. Although the composition of 2D lenses is well known, 3D composition was long considered infeasible due to both geometric and semantic complexity. Nonetheless, for a scene with multiple interactive 3D lenses, the problem of intersecting lenses must be considered. Intersecting 3D lenses in meaningful ways supports new interfaces such as hierarchical 3D windows, 3D lenses for managing and composing visualization options, or interactive shader development by direct manipulation of lenses providing component effects. Our 3D volumetric lens approach differs from other approaches and is one of the first to address efficient composition of multiple lenses. It is well-suited to head-tracked VR environments because it requires no view-dependent generation of major data structures, allowing caching and reuse of full or partial results. A Composite Shader Factory module composes shader programs for rendering composite visual styles and geometry of intersection regions. Geometry is handled by Boolean combinations of region tests in fragment shaders, which allows both convex and nonconvex CSG volumes for lens shape. Efficiency is further addressed by a Region Analyzer module and by broad-phase culling. Finally, we consider the handling of order effects for composed 3D lenses.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.89","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5184832","Interaction styles;virtual reality;volumetric lens;windowing systems.","Lenses;Virtual reality;Layout;Rendering (computer graphics);Visualization;Geometry;Shape;Data structures;Production facilities;Testing","interactive systems;performance evaluation;real-time systems;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","real time rendering method;performance evaluation;composable 3D lense;interactive VR;polygonal scene;volumetric lense;2D magic lenses;geometric complexity;semantic complexity;multiple interactive 3D lenses;composite shader factory module;Boolean combination;region analyzer module;hierarchical 3D window","Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Computer-Aided Design;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Lenses;Models, Theoretical;Software;User-Computer Interface","6","","19","IEEE","31 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objects and their relationships are organized as a heterogeneous graph. We assign each object a set of attributes, based on which a semantic abstraction of the heterogeneous graph is generated. This semantic abstraction is SFG. We design a suite of operations to explore the underlying flow fields based on this graph representation and abstraction mechanism. Users can flexibly reconfigure SFG to examine the relationships among groups of objects at different abstraction levels. Three linked views are developed to display SFG, its node split criteria and history, and the objects in the spatial volume. For simplicity, we introduce SFG construction and exploration for steady flow fields with critical points being the only features.

Our animations rely on the combination and the interpolation of textured 3D mesh data, which requires examining two aspects: (1) Shape geometry and (2) appearance. First, we propose an animation synthesis structure for the shape geometry, the Essential graph, that outperforms standard Motion graphs in optimality with respect to quantitative criteria, and we extend optimized interpolated transition algorithms to mesh data. Second, we propose a compact view-independent representation for the shape appearance.

For time-critical workloads such as interactive visualization, the bottleneck is no longer computation but communication. In this paper, we present an image compositing algorithm that works on both CPU-only and GPU-accelerated supercomputers and focuses on communication avoidance and overlapping communication with computation at the expense of evenly balancing the workload. The algorithm has three stages: a parallel direct send stage, followed by a tree compositing stage and a gather stage. We compare our algorithm with radix-k and binary-swap from the IceT library in a hybrid OpenMP/MPI setting on the Stampede and Edison supercomputers, show strong scaling results and explain how we generally achieve better performance than these two algorithms.

"Uncovering Data Landscapes through Data Reconnaissance and Task Wrangling","A. Crisan; T.

In this paper, we consider the data landscape that domain experts seek to understand, namely the set of datasets that are either currently available or could be obtained. Experts need to understand this landscape to triage which data analysis projects might be viable, out of the many possible research questions that they could pursue. We identify data reconnaissance and task wrangling as processes that experts undertake to discover and identify sources of data that could be valuable for some specific analysis goal. These processes have thus far not been formally named or defined by the research community. We provide formal definitions of data reconnaissance and task wrangling and describe how they relate to the data landscape that domain experts must uncover. We propose a conceptual framework with a four-phase cycle of acquire, view, assess, and pursue that occurs within three distinct chronological stages, which we call fog and friction, informed data ideation, and demarcation of final data. Collectively, these four phases embedded within three temporal stages delineate an expert's progressively evolving understanding of the data landscape. We describe and provide concrete examples of these processes within the visualization community through an initial systematic analysis of previous design studies, identifying situations where there is evidence that they were at play. We also comment on the response of domain experts to this framework, and suggest design implications stemming from these processes to motivate future research directions. As technological changes will only keep adding unknown terrain to the data landscape, data reconnaissance and task wrangling are important processes that need to be more widely understood and supported by the data visualization tools. By articulating a concrete understanding of this challenge and its implications, our work impacts the design and evaluation of data visualization systems.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933542","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization design and evaluation methods","Task analysis;Data visualization;Reconnaissance;Visualization;Tools;Friction","data analysis;data visualisation","data landscape;data reconnaissance;task wrangling;data visualization tools;data visualization systems;data analysis projects;data ideation","","6","","15","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is accomplished without iteration while conforming to a user-specified spacing between hyperstreamlines and avoids possible failure modes associated with hyperstreamline integration in the vicinity of degeneracies in alignment (orientational defects).

Having established a mapping from the configuration space to the energy graph, a fast and robust local motion planning algorithm is introduced to solve the BVP to generate motions that could only previously be computed by global planning methods. In the second stage, a projection of the solution motion onto a constraint manifold is proposed for more user control. Our method can be integrated into current keyframing techniques.

By using clusters of PCs, enormous cost savings can be realized, and proprietary ""high-end"" hardware is no longer necessary for these tasks. Our architecture minimizes the amount of synchronization needed between PCs, resulting in excellent scalability. It provides a modular framework that can accommodate a wide variety of rendering algorithms and data formats, provided that the rendering algorithms can generate pixels individually and the data is duplicated on each PC. Demonstration modules that implement ray tracing, fractal rendering, and volume rendering algorithms were developed to evaluate the architecture. Results are encouraging-using 15 PCs connected to a standard 100 Megabit/s Ethernet network, the system can interactively render simple to moderately complex data sets at modest resolution. Excellent scalability is achieved; however, our tests were limited to a cluster of 15 PCs.

Many classification models exist, and choosing the right one for a given task is difficult. During model selection and debugging, data scientists need to assess classifiers' performances, evaluate their learning behavior over time, and compare different models. Typically, this analysis is based on single-number performance measures such as accuracy. A more detailed evaluation of classifiers is possible by inspecting class errors. The confusion matrix is an established way for visualizing these class errors, but it was not designed with temporal or comparative analysis in mind. More generally, established performance analysis systems do not allow a combined temporal and comparative analysis of class-level information. To address this issue, we propose ConfusionFlow, an interactive, comparative visualization tool that combines the benefits of class confusion matrices with the visualization of performance characteristics over time. ConfusionFlow is model-agnostic and can be used to compare performances for different model types, model architectures, and/or training and test datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of ConfusionFlow in a case study on instance selection strategies in active learning. We further assess the scalability of ConfusionFlow and present a use case in the context of neural network pruning.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3012063","State of Upper Austria; Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung(grant numbers:LIT-2019-7-SEE-117); State of Upper Austria; Austrian Research Promotion Agency(grant numbers:FFG 851460); Austrian Science Fund(grant numbers:FWF P27975-NBL); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149790","Classification;performance analysis;time series visualization;machine learning;information visualization;quality assessment","Task analysis;Analytical models;Data models;Training;Tools;Adaptation models;Data visualization","data visualisation;feature selection;matrix algebra;neural nets;pattern classification;supervised learning","active learning;ConfusionFlow;model-agnostic visualization;classifier confusion;supervised machine learning;confusion matrix;temporal analysis;class-level information;class confusion matrices;performance characteristics;instance selection strategies;neural network pruning","","5","","63","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first introduce a novel method to make representative and nonredundant summarizations of image collections, thereby ensuring data cleanliness and emphasizing important information. Then, we propose a tree-based algorithm with a two-step optimization strategy to generate the final layout that operates as follows: (1) an initial layout is created by constructing a tree randomly based on the grouping results of the input image set; (2) the layout is refined through a coarse adjustment in a greedy manner, followed by gradient back propagation drawing on the training procedure of neural networks.

The inbetweening is context-aware in the sense that not only the stroke's shape but also the context (i.e., the neighborhood of a stroke) in which a stroke appears are taken into account for the stroke correspondence and interpolation. Given a pair of successive key frames, the CACAI automatically constructs the stroke correspondence between them by exploiting the context coherence between the corresponding strokes. Meanwhile, the construction algorithm is able to incorporate the user's interaction with ease and allows the user more effective control over the correspondence process than existing stroke matching techniques. With a one-to-one stroke correspondence, the CACAI interpolates the shape and context between the corresponding strokes for the generation of intermediate frames. In the interpolation sequence, both the shape of individual strokes and the spatial layout between them are well retained such that the feature characteristics and visual appearance of the objects in the key frames can be fully preserved even when complex motions are involved in these objects.

However, often dynamic graphs are expressed as a series of events where the nodes and edges have real coordinates along the time dimension that are not confined to discrete timeslices. Current techniques for dynamic graph drawing impose a set of timeslices on this event-based data in order to draw the dynamic graph, but it is unclear how many timeslices should be selected: too many timeslices slows the computation of the layout, while too few timeslices obscures important temporal features, such as causality. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel model for drawing event-based dynamic graphs and the first dynamic graph drawing algorithm, DynNoSlice, that is capable of drawing dynamic graphs in this model. DynNoSlice is an offline, force-directed algorithm that draws event-based, dynamic graphs in the space-time cube (2D+time). We also present a method to extract representative small multiples from the space-time cube. To demonstrate the advantages of our approach, DynNoSlice is compared with state-of-the-art timeslicing methods using a metrics-based experiment.

It provides enhancements of computational efficiency and accuracy control with respect to previous solutions. Iterative refinement allows us to perform interactive animations which could be only computed off-line using previous methods. The efficiency results from managing two sets of constraints associated with the kinematic graph, and proceeding in two steps. First, the acyclic constraints are solved in linear time. An iterative process then reduces the closed-loop errors while maintaining the acyclic constraints. This allows the user to efficiently trade off accuracy for computation time. We analyze the complexity and investigate practical efficiency compared with other approaches. In contrast with previous research, we present a single method which is computationally efficient for acyclic bodies as well as for mesh-like bodies. The accuracy control is provided by the iterative improvement performed by the algorithm and also from the existence of two constraint priority levels induced by the method. Used in conjunction with a robust integration scheme, this new algorithm allows the interactive animation of scenes containing a few thousand geometric constraints, including closed loops.

The method is based on a two-pass strategy that provides user-control on the final frame quality. In the first pass, it computes a coarse global solution of the radiosities along a time interval and then, in the second pass, it performs a frame-to-frame incremental gathering step using hardware graphic accelerators. Computing cost is thus reduced because the method takes advantage of frame-to-frame coherence by identifying the changes produced by dynamic objects and by decoupling them from computations that remain unchanged. The input data is a dynamic model of the environment through a period of time corresponding to the same camera recording. The method proceeds by incrementally updating two data structures: a space-time hierarchical radiosity solution for a given interval of time and a hierarchical tree of textures representing the space-time final illumination of the visible surfaces. These data structures are computed for a given viewpoint, either static or dynamic. The main contribution of this work is the efficient construction of the texture tree by identifying the changes produced by dynamic objects and by only recomputing these changes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2003.1175098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175098","","Animation;Production;Layout;Hardware;Graphics;Costs;Coherence;Cameras;Tree data structures;Lighting","computer animation;realistic images","high quality radiosity;a priori knowledge;scene;temporal coherence;hardware graphic accelerators;data structures;energy transport;photo-realistic animations;animation","","5","","29","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An essential difference to the known methods for rendering graph surfaces is that we use quartic smooth splines on triangulations rather than triangular meshes. Our rendering approach is direct since we do not use an intermediate tessellation but rather compute ray-surface intersections (by solving quartic equations numerically) as well as surface normals (by using Bernstein-Bezier techniques) for Phong illumination on the GPU. Inaccurate shading and artifacts appearing for triangular tesselated surfaces are completely avoided. Level of detail is automatic since all computations are done on a per fragment basis. We compare three different (quasi-) interpolating schemes for uniformly sampled gridded data, which differ in the smoothness and the approximation properties of the splines.

In this paper, we propose achieving interactive transparency rendering of a static scene by sorting the triangles in back-to-front order on CPU and supplying the sorted triangles to the graphics pipeline for rendering on GPU hardware. Our sorting method sorts the triangles in object space and is built upon the binary space partition (BSP) and depth-sort methods with its behavior readily tunable to exploit the strengths of both methods. We propose novel techniques to optimize the BSP construction process with respect to multiple factors including tree construction time, tree size, and expected sorting cost. We also propose an improved depth-sort algorithm that can produce correct depth order without triangle split when no cyclic occlusion exists. We demonstrate that the proposed system results in a penalty factor of 4/spl sim/6 for various types of parts, among which the largest one has nearly 1.2 million triangles. In addition, the penalty factor may be further improved if sorting in CPU and rendering in GPU are executed in parallel. Two approximation strategies are also studied to test the practicality of our system against large CAD assemblies. Experimental results on an assembly containing over 16 million triangles distributed in about 10,000 transparent parts show that the proposed system still results in a penalty factor of 4/spl sim/6 while producing few artifacts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.82","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1471695","Index Terms- BSP;depth sort;transparency rendering;triangle sorting.","Rendering (computer graphics);Sorting;Graphics;Layout;Assembly systems;Inspection;Visualization;Pipelines;Hardware;Cost function","CAD;engineering graphics;rendering (computer graphics);data visualisation;solid modelling;interactive systems;computer graphic equipment;tree data structures;computational geometry;sorting","interactive transparency rendering;large CAD model;scene rendering;visual inspection;engineering visualization;graphics pipeline;GPU hardware rendering;binary space partition construction;depth-sort algorithm;tree construction;tree size;cyclic occlusion;triangle sorting","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Computer-Aided Design;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Theoretical;User-Computer Interface","5","1","15","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective of this project is to design a tracking solution for fully enclosed VR displays that achieves comparable performance to available commercial solutions but without any artifacts that can obscure the user's view. JanusVF is a tracking solution involving a cooperation of both the hardware sensors and the software rendering system. A small, high-resolution camera is worn on the user's head, but faces backward (180 degree rotation about vertical from the user's perspective). After acquisition of the initial state, the VR rendering software draws specific fiducial markers with known size and absolute position inside the VR scene. These virtual markers are only drawn behind the user and in view of the camera. These fiducials are tracked by ARToolkitPlus and integrated by a single-constraint-at-a-time (SCAAT) filter algorithm to update the head pose.

We model the exposure prediction function as a fully convolutional neural network that can be trained through Gaussian policy gradient in an end-to-end fashion. As a result, our system can associate scene semantics with exposure values; it can also be extended to personalize the exposure adjustments for a user and device. We improve the learning performance by incorporating an adaptive metering module that links semantics with exposure.

To achieve this goal, we combine the power of Unet [1] and Squeezenet [2] to train an efficient convolutional neural network for pixel classification. In addition, we track the 3D eye gaze state in the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) framework, which sequentially searches for the most likely state of the 3D eye gaze at each frame. When eye blinking occurs, the eye gaze tracker can obtain an inaccurate result. We further extend the convolutional neural network for eye close detection in order to improve the robustness and accuracy of the eye gaze tracker. Our system runs in realtime on desktop PCs and smart phones. We have evaluated our system on live videos and Internet videos, and our results demonstrate that the system is robust and accurate for various genders, races, lighting conditions, poses, shapes and facial expressions.

However, the widely known modifiable areal unit problem within such aggregation processes can lead to perturbations in the network inputs. This issue can significantly destabilize the feature embeddings and the predictions - rendering deep networks much less useful for the experts. This paper approaches this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques that enable the investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied multi-scalar aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions. Through regular exchanges with a domain expert, we design and develop a visual analytics solution that integrates 1) a Bivariate Map equipped with an advanced bivariate colormap to simultaneously depict input traffic and prediction errors across space, 2) a Moran's I Scatterplot that provides local indicators of spatial association analysis, and 3) a Multi-scale Attribution View that arranges non-linear dot plots in a tree layout to promote model analysis and comparison across scales. We evaluate our approach through a series of case studies involving a real-world dataset of Shenzhen taxi trips, and through interviews with domain experts. We observe that geographical scale variations have important impact on prediction performances, and interactive visual exploration of dynamically varying inputs and outputs benefit experts in the development of deep traffic prediction models.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030410","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802388,61702433,61872389,41701452,61772456,U1609217); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9228894","MAUP;traffic prediction;deep learning;model diagnostic;visual analytics","Predictive models;Visual analytics;Data visualization;Analytical models;Uncertainty;Perturbation methods","data analysis;data visualisation;geographic information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;traffic information systems","visual analytics solution;advanced bivariate colormap;prediction errors;spatial association analysis;arranges nonlinear dot plots;model analysis;domain expert;prediction performances;interactive visual exploration;deep traffic prediction models;urban traffic prediction;spatiotemporal traffic data;sequentially organized matrices;convolution-based residual neural networks;modifiable areal unit problem;aggregation processes;network inputs;feature embeddings;deep networks;unit visualization techniques;dynamically varied multiscalar aggregations;urban traffic data;neural network predictions;multiscale attribution view;bivariate map;Moran I scatterplot;Shenzhen taxi trips","","5","","54","IEEE","16 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Until now, there has been little data to indicate at what level of complexity node-link diagrams become ineffective or how visual complexity affects cognitive load. To this end, we conducted a controlled study to understand workload limits for a task that requires a detailed understanding of the network topology-finding the shortest path between two nodes. We tested performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected performance measures (accuracy and response time), subjective feedback, and physiological measures (EEG, pupil dilation, and heart rate variability). To the best of our knowledge this is the first network visualisation study to include physiological measures. Our results show that people have significant difficulty finding the shortest path in high density node-link diagrams with more than 50 nodes and even low density graphs with more than 100 nodes. From our collected EEG data we observe functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. We found that cognitive load increased up to certain level of difficulty after which it decreased, likely because participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty. We found that global features generally had a greater impact than those of the shortest path.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030459","Australian Research Council (ARC)(grant numbers:DP140100077); Harvard Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290431","Data Visualisation;Network Visualisation;Cognitive Load;EEG","Task analysis;Data visualization;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Electroencephalography;Visualization;Physiology","cognition;electroencephalography;feedback;medical signal processing;neural nets","network topology;heart rate variability;network visualisation;high density node-link diagrams;cognitive load perspective;network layout algorithms;complexity node-link diagrams;visual complexity;EEG;pupil dilation;brain activity","Algorithms;Cognition;Computer Graphics;Humans","5","","67","IEEE","10 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sketch-R2CNN takes a vector sketch as input and uses an RNN for extracting per-point features in the vector space. We then develop a neural line rasterization module to convert the vector sketch and the per-point features to multi-channel point feature maps, which are subsequently fed to a CNN for extracting convolutional features in the pixel space. Our neural line rasterization module is designed in a differentiable way for end-to-end learning.

Participant responses and their impression of the virtual characters were evaluated through a wide variety of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Combining a controlled experimental approach with various data-collection methods provided a number of advantages such as providing a reason to the quantitative results. The quantitative results indicate that posture plays an important role in the communication of affect by virtual characters. The qualitative findings indicated that participants attribute a variety of psychological states to the behavioral cues displayed by virtual characters.

However, the interactive exploration and seamless refinement of such hypergraph-based prediction models still pose a major challenge. We contribute Hyper-Matrix, a novel visual analytics technique that addresses this challenge through a tight coupling between machine-learning and interactive visualizations. In particular, the technique incorporates a geometric deep learning model as a blueprint for problem-specific models while integrating visualizations for graph-based and category-based data with a novel combination of interactions for an effective user-driven exploration of hypergraph models. To eliminate demanding context switches and ensure scalability, our matrix-based visualization provides drill-down capabilities across multiple levels of semantic zoom, from an overview of model predictions down to the content. We facilitate a focused analysis of relevant connections and groups based on interactive user-steering for filtering and search tasks, a dynamically modifiable partition hierarchy, various matrix reordering techniques, and interactive model feedback. We evaluate our technique in a case study and through formative evaluation with law enforcement experts using real-world internet forum communication data.

Analyzing such cascading processes presents valuable implications in various urban applications, such as traffic planning and pollution diagnostics. Motivated by the limited capability of the existing approaches in mining and interpreting cascading patterns, we propose a visual analytics system called VisCas. VisCas combines an inference model with interactive visualizations and empowers analysts to infer and interpret the latent cascading patterns in the spatiotemporal context. To develop VisCas, we address three major challenges, 1) generalized pattern inference, 2) implicit influence visualization, and 3) multifaceted cascade analysis. For the first challenge, we adapt the state-of-the-art cascading network inference technique to general urban scenarios, where cascading patterns can be reliably inferred from large-scale spatiotemporal data. For the second and third challenges, we assemble a set of effective visualizations to support location navigation, influence inspection, and cascading exploration, and facilitate the in-depth cascade analysis. We design a novel influence view based on a three-fold optimization strategy for analyzing the implicit influences of the inferred patterns. We demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of VisCas with two case studies conducted on real-world traffic congestion and air pollution datasets with domain experts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3071387","The 100 Talents Program of Zhejiang University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822701,62072400); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LR18F020001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9397369","Spatial cascade;pattern mining;spatiotemporal data","Spatiotemporal phenomena;Air pollution;Probabilistic logic;Adaptation models;Visual analytics;Time series analysis;Sensors","","","","5","","","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, these assessments are mostly carried out through user studies. There is a lack of automatic visualization assessment approaches, which hinders further applications like visualization recommendation, indexing, and generation. In this paper, we propose automating the visualization assessment process with modern machine learning approaches. We utilize a semi-supervised learning method, which first employs Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn effective features from visualizations, subsequently training machine learning models for different assessment tasks. Then, we can automatically assess new visualization images by predicting their scores or rankings with the trained model. To evaluate our method, we run two different assessment tasks, namely, aesthetics and memorability, on different visualization datasets. Experiments show that our method can learn effective visual features and achieves good performance on these assessment tasks.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933570","Visualization;automated design;visualization assessment;presentation","Task analysis;Visualization;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Data visualization;Training;Predictive models","data visualisation;supervised learning","visual features;automatic visualization assessment approaches;visualization recommendation;visualization assessment process;semisupervised learning method;machine learning models;visualization images;variational autoencoder","","5","","34","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We found this to be the case in the domain of task parallel computing where such data and tooling is an open area of research. Despite these hurdles, we conducted a design study. Through a tightly-coupled iterative design process, we built Atria, a multi-view execution graph visualization to support performance analysis. Atria simplifies the initial representation of the execution graph by aggregating nodes as related to their line of code. We deployed Atria on multiple platforms, some requiring design alteration. We describe how we adapted the design study methodology to the âmoving targetâ of both the data and the domain experts' concerns and how this movement kept both the visualization and programming project healthy.

Our work makes an attempt towards recovering two types of primitive-shaped objects, namely, generalized cuboids and generalized cylinders. To this end, we build a novel instance-aware segmentation network for accurate part separation. Our GeoNet outputs a set of smooth part-level masks labeled as profiles and bodies. Then in a key stage, we simultaneously identify profile-body relations and recover 3D parts by sweeping the recognized profile along their body contour and jointly optimize the geometry to align with the recovered masks.

If a clinician suspects a patient has a stroke or other cerebrovascular condition, they order imaging tests. Neuroradiologists visually search the resulting scans for abnormalities. Their visual search tasks correspond to the abstract network analysis tasks of browsing and path following. To assist neuroradiologists in identifying cerebral artery abnormalities, we designed CerebroVis, a novel abstract-yet spatially contextualized-cerebral artery network visualization. In this design study, we contribute a novel framing and definition of the cerebral artery system in terms of network theory and characterize neuroradiologist domain goals as abstract visualization and network analysis tasks. Through an iterative, user-centered design process we developed an abstract network layout technique which incorporates cerebral artery spatial context. The abstract visualization enables increased domain task performance over 3D geometry representations, while including spatial context helps preserve the user's mental map of the underlying geometry. We provide open source implementations of our network layout technique and prototype cerebral artery visualization tool. We demonstrate the robustness of our technique by successfully laying out 61 open source brain scans. We evaluate the effectiveness of our layout through a mixed methods study with three neuroradiologists.

Users can first glance at the score chart to roughly obtain the growth and decline of advantages from both sides, and then examine the position relations and the piece placements, to know how the pieces are controlled and how the strategy works. To achieve this visualization, we compute the decision tree using artificial intelligence to analyze a game, in which each node represents a chess position and each edge connects two positions that are one-move different. We then merge nodes representing the same chess position, and shorten branches where nodes on them contain only two neighbors, in order to achieve readability. During the graph rendering, the nodes containing events such as draws, effective checks and checkmates, are highlighted because they show how a game is ended. As a result, our visualization helps players understand a chess game so that they can efficiently learn strategies and tactics.

We therefore briefly review related work around hierarchical PC using aggregation or nesting techniques.

Emulating such social activity requires serious attention to the interplay of visual perception, navigation in constrained doorway environments, manipulation of a variety of door types, and high-level decision making based on social considerations. To tackle this complex human simulation problem, we take an artificial life approach to modeling autonomous pedestrians, proposing a layered architecture comprising mental, behavioral, and motor layers. The behavioral layer couples two stages: (1) a decentralized, agent-based strategy for dynamically determining the well-mannered ordering of pedestrians around doorways, and (2) a state-based model that directs and coordinates a pedestrian's interactions with the door. The mental layer is a Bayesian network decision model that dynamically selects appropriate door-holding behaviors by considering both internal and external social factors pertinent to pedestrians interacting with one another in and around doorways.

Specifically, typical studies of gene co-expression require novel visualization tools that enable the dynamic formulation and fine-tuning of hypotheses to aid the process of evaluating sensitivity of key parameters. These tools should allow biologists to develop an intuitive understanding of the structure of biological networks and discover genes residing in critical positions in networks and pathways. By using a graph as a universal representation of correlation in gene expression, our system employs several techniques that when used in an integrated manner provide innovative analytical capabilities. Our tool for interacting with gene co-expression data integrates techniques such as: graph layout, qualitative subgraph extraction through a novel 2D user interface, quantitative subgraph extraction using graph-theoretic algorithms or by compound queries, dynamic level-of-detail abstraction, and template-based fuzzy classification.

Specifically, the topology information is used to create a dual structure that contains nodes and connectivity information for every segmentable region in the original data set. This graph structure, along with a sampled representation of the segmented data set, is embedded into a standard raster image which can then be substantially downsampled and compressed. During rendering, the raster image is upsampled and the dual graph is used to reconstruct the original function. Unlike traditional raster approaches, our representation can preserve sharp discontinuities at any level of magnification, much like scalable vector graphics. However, because our representation is raster-based, it is well suited to the real-time rendering pipeline. We demonstrate this by reconstructing our data sets on graphics hardware at real-time rates.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376170","Topology;Compression;Image Representation;Multi-field Visualization","Topology;Image segmentation;Rendering (computer graphics);Image reconstruction;Graphics;Data analysis;Data visualization;Image analysis;Image coding;Pipelines","image representation;image segmentation;rendering (computer graphics);topology","IStar;raster representation;scalable image representation;volume data;multivariate image;topology information;graph structure;segmented data set;dual graph;real-time rendering;graphics hardware;real-time rates","","4","1","28","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In other words, only a few stations are controlled and the remaining stations are relocated by our system. Our system supports both curvilinear and octilinear layouts when creating metro maps. It solves an optimization problem, in which even spaces, route straightness, and maximum included angles at junctions are considered to obtain a curvilinear result. The system then rotates each edge to extend either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally while approximating the station positions provided by users to generate an octilinear layout.

With the wider availability of mesh data, an efficient and intrinsic deep learning approach to processing 3D meshes is in great need. Unlike images, 3D meshes have irregular connectivity, requiring careful design to capture relations in the data. To utilize the topology information while staying robust under different triangulations, we propose to encode mesh connectivity using Laplacian spectral analysis, along with mesh feature aggregation blocks (MFABs) that can split the surface domain into local pooling patches and aggregate global information amongst them. We build a mesh hierarchy from fine to coarse using Laplacian spectral clustering, which is flexible under isometric transformations. Inside the MFABs there are pooling layers to collect local information and multi-layer perceptrons to compute vertex features of increasing complexity. To obtain the relationships among different clusters, we introduce a Correlation Net to compute a correlation matrix, which can aggregate the features globally by matrix multiplication with cluster features. Our network architecture is flexible enough to be used on meshes with different numbers of vertices. We conduct several experiments including shape segmentation and classification, and our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for these tasks on the ShapeNet and COSEG datasets.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3014449","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872440,61828204); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L182016); Royal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship(grant numbers:NAF\R2\192151); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition(grant numbers:201900055); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159927","Mesh processing;segmentation;laplacian;deep learning","Three-dimensional displays;Laplace equations;Shape;Correlation;Machine learning;Topology;Computational modeling","belief networks;computational geometry;computer graphics;computer vision;feature extraction;graph theory;image coding;image recognition;image representation;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);mesh generation;multilayer perceptrons;object recognition;pattern clustering;solid modelling;spectral analysis","cluster features;computer vision;wider availability;mesh data;efficient learning approach;intrinsic deep learning approach;irregular connectivity;topology information;different triangulations;mesh connectivity;Laplacian spectral analysis;mesh feature aggregation blocks;MFABs;local pooling patches;aggregate global information;mesh hierarchy;coarse using Laplacian spectral clustering;local information;vertex features","","4","","61","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a scalar field f and a selection of extrema to preserve, the proposed localized topological simplification (LTS) derives a function g that is close to f and only exhibits the selected set of extrema. Specifically, suband superlevel set components associated with undesired extrema are first locally flattened and then correctly embedded into the global scalar field, such that these regions are guaranteed-from a combinatorial perspective-to no longer contain any undesired extrema. In contrast to previous global approaches, LTS only and independently processes regions of the domain that actually need to be simplified, which already results in a noticeable speedup. Moreover, due to the localized nature of the algorithm, LTS can utilize shared-memory parallelism to simplify regions simultaneously with a high parallel efficiency (70%). Hence, LTS significantly improves interactivity for the exploration of simplification parameters and their effect on subsequent topological analysis. For such exploration tasks, LTS brings the overall execution time of a plethora of TDA pipelines from minutes down to seconds, with an average observed speedup over state-of-the-art techniques of up to Ã36. Furthermore, in the special case where preserved extrema are selected based on topological persistence, an adapted version of LTS partially computes the persistence diagram and simultaneously simplifies features below a predefined persistence threshold. The effectiveness of LTS, its parallel efficiency, and its resulting benefits for TDA are demonstrated on several simulated and acquired datasets from different application domains, including physics, chemistry, and biomedical imaging.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030353","U.S. Department of Homeland Security(grant numbers:2017-ST-061-QA0001,17STQAC00001-03-03); National Science Foundation Program(grant numbers:1350573); European Commission(grant numbers:ERC-2019-COG); âTORIâ(grant numbers:863464); German research foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:2057); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222093","Topological data analysis;scalar data;simplification;feature extraction;parallel computing","Computational modeling;Parallel processing;Data visualization;Data analysis;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Topology","computational geometry;data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;parallel algorithms","localized topological simplification;scalar data;localized algorithm;topological data analysis;topological analysis;shared memory parallelism;parallel computing;visualization tasks","","4","","60","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent research on point cloud upsampling has achieved great success due to the development of deep learning. However, the existing methods regard point cloud upsampling of different scale factors as independent tasks. Thus, the methods need to train a specific model for each scale factor, which is both inefficient and impractical for storage and computation in real applications. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a novel method called ``Meta-PU"" to firstly support point cloud upsampling of arbitrary scale factors with a single model. In the Meta-PU method, besides the backbone network consisting of residual graph convolution (RGC) blocks, a meta-subnetwork is learned to adjust the weights of the RGC blocks dynamically, and a farthest sampling block is adopted to sample different numbers of points. Together, these two blocks enable our Meta-PU to continuously upsample the point cloud with arbitrary scale factors by using only a single model. In addition, the experiments reveal that training on multiple scales simultaneously is beneficial to each other. Thus, Meta-PU even outperforms the existing methods trained for a specific scale factor only.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3058311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351772","Point cloud;upsampling;meta-learning;deep learning","Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Convolution;Neural networks;Deep learning;Computational modeling","","","","4","","","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The 2D or 3D O-buffer is, in essence, a conventional image or a volume, respectively, except that samples are not restricted to a regular grid. A sample position in the O-buffer is recorded as an offset to the nearest grid point of a regular base grid (hence the name O-buffer). The O-buffer can greatly improve the expressive power of images and volumes. Image quality can be improved by storing more spatial information with samples and by avoiding multiple resamplings. It can be exploited to represent and render unstructured primitives, such as points, particles, and curvilinear or irregular volumes. The O-buffer is therefore a unified representation for a variety of graphics primitives and supports mixing them in the same scene. It is a semiregular structure which lends itself to efficient construction and rendering. O-buffers may assume a variety of forms including 2D O-buffers, 3D O-buffers, uniform O-buffers, nonuniform O-buffers, adaptive O-buffers, layered-depth O-buffers, and O-buffer trees.

A package dependency contains dependencies between all packages required to build and run the target software. Package management system developers, package maintainers, and users may consult the dependency graph when a simple listing is insufficient for their analyses. However, users working in a remote command line environment must disrupt their workflow to visualize dependency graphs in graphical programs, possibly needing to move files between devices or incur forwarding lag. Such is the case for users of Spack, an open source package management system originally developed to ease the complex builds required by supercomputing environments. To preserve the command line workflow of Spack, we develop an interactive ASCII visualization for its dependency graphs.

To guarantee the high quality of such learning materials, question designers need to inspect how students' problem-solving processes unfold step by step to infer whether students' problem-solving logic matches their design intent. They also need to compare the behaviors of different groups (e.g., students from different grades) to distribute questions to students with the right level of knowledge. The availability of fine-grained interaction data, such as mouse movement trajectories from the online platforms, provides the opportunity to analyze problem-solving behaviors. However, it is still challenging to interpret, summarize, and compare the high dimensional problem-solving sequence data. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system, QLens, to help question designers inspect detailed problem-solving trajectories, compare different student groups, distill insights for design improvements. In particular, QLens models problem-solving behavior as a hybrid state transition graph and visualizes it through a novel glyph-embedded Sankey diagram, which reflects students' problem-solving logic, engagement, and encountered difficulties. We conduct three case studies and three expert interviews to demonstrate the usefulness of QLens on real-world datasets that consist of thousands of problem-solving traces.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030337","Theme-based Research Scheme of the Hong Kong RGC(grant numbers:T44-707/16-N); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222360","Learning Behavior Analysis;Visual Analytics;Time Series Data","Problem-solving;Hidden Markov models;Visual analytics;Data visualization;Task analysis;Programming","data analysis;data visualisation;educational administrative data processing","multistep questions;problem-solving skills;question designers;online platforms;high dimensional problem-solving sequence data;visual analytics system;design improvements;problem-solving traces;question design;multistep problem-solving behaviors;problem-solving behavior;online education;hybrid state transition graph;glyph-embedded Sankey diagram;learning platforms;QLens","","4","","51","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the standard shallow-water flow model is extended to general triangle meshes with a feature-based bottom friction model, and a series of coherent mathematical formulations are derived to represent the full range of physical effects that are important for real-world surface flow phenomena. In addition, by achieving compatibility with existing 3D fluid simulators and by supporting physically realistic interactions with multiple fluids and solid surfaces, the new model is flexible and readily extensible for coupled phenomena.

In this article, by doing a detailed optical analysis of the sampling process in an LFC, we show that the effective resolution is generally higher than the number of micro-lenses. This contribution makes it theoretically possible to super-resolve a light field. Further optical analysis proves the â2D predictable seriesâ nature of the 4D light field, which provides new insights for analyzing light field using series processing techniques. To model this nature, a specifically designed epipolar plane image (EPI) based CNN-LSTM network is proposed to super-resolve a light field in the spatial and angular dimensions simultaneously. Rather than leveraging semantic information, our network focuses on extracting geometric continuity in the EPI domain. This gives our method an improved generalization ability and makes it applicable to a wide range of previously unseen scenes. Experiments on both synthetic and real light fields demonstrate the improvements over state-of-the-arts, especially in large disparity areas.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2957761","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61531014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8924770","Spatio-angular trade-off;light field reconstruction;super-resolution;epipolar plane image;LSTM","Spatial resolution;Image reconstruction;Two dimensional displays;Optical imaging;Lenses;Frequency modulation","angular measurement;cameras;image resolution;image sampling;optical sensors","optical analysis;synthetic light field cameras;epipolar plane image based CNN-LSTM network;LFC;2D predictable series;4D light field analysis;EPI","","4","","65","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many analysis tasks for such spaces require several foci while retaining context and distance awareness. In this extended version of our IEEE PacificVis 2010 paper, we introduce a method for supporting this kind of multifocus interaction that we call stack zooming. The approach is based on building hierarchies of 1D strips stacked on top of each other, where each subsequent stack represents a higher zoom level, and sibling strips represent branches in the exploration. Correlation graphics show the relation between stacks and strips of different levels, providing context and distance awareness for the foci. The zoom hierarchies can also be used as graphical histories and for communicating insights to stakeholders and can be further extended with annotation and integrated statistics.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392832","Multifocus interaction;temporal data;comparative visualization;visual exploration;visual analytics;interaction","Visualization;Strips;Context;Layout;Navigation;Nonlinear distortion;Vegetation","data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics)","stack zooming;multifocus interaction;skewed-aspect visual space;2D visual space;time-series data;multimedia data;1D strips;correlation graphics;context awareness;distance awareness","","4","","42","","24 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, low-cost, high-frame-rate video cameras are available. This motivates us to develop a hybrid camera that consists of a high-frame-rate video camera and a low-frame-rate depth camera and to allow temporal interpolation of depth maps with the help of auxiliary color images. To achieve this, we develop a novel algorithm that reconstructs intermediate depth maps and estimates scene flow simultaneously. We test our algorithm on various examples involving fast, non-rigid motions of single or multiple objects.

In order to support visual exploration of biclusters, bipartite graphs based visualizations have been proposed, and edge bundling is used to show biclusters. However, it suffers from edge crossings due to possible overlaps of biclusters, and lacks in-depth understanding of its impact on user exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs. To address these, we propose a novel bicluster-based seriation technique that can reduce edge crossings in bipartite graphs drawing and conducted a user experiment to study the effect of edge bundling and this proposed technique on visualizing biclusters in bipartite graphs. We found that they both had impact on reducing entity visits for users exploring biclusters, and edge bundles helped them find more justified answers. Moreover, we identified four key trade-offs that inform the design of future bicluster visualizations.

Yet reproductions of single bars or groups of bars within a graph can be biased. Curiously, some previous work found that this bias resulted in an overestimation of reproduced data values, while other work found an underestimation. Across three empirical studies, we offer an explanation for these conflicting findings: this discrepancy is a consequence of the differing aspect ratios of the tested bar marks. Viewers are biased to remember a bar mark as being more similar to a prototypical square, leading to an overestimation of bars with a wide aspect ratio, and an underestimation of bars with a tall aspect ratio. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the aspect ratio of the bar marks indeed influenced the direction of this bias. Experiment 3 confirmed that this pattern of misestimation bias was present for reproductions from memory, suggesting that this bias may arise when comparing values across sequential displays or views. We describe additional visualization designs that might be prone to this bias beyond bar charts (e.g., Mekko charts and treemaps), and speculate that other visual channels might hold similar biases toward prototypical values.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030422","National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(grant numbers:DGE-1842165,IIS-1901485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222047","Memory biases;position estimation;bar charts;aspect ratio;area","Bars;Image color analysis;Encoding;Visualization;Data visualization;Estimation;Prototypes","data visualisation;visual perception","bar mark;misestimation bias;bar charts;similar biases;prototypical values;position encoding;overestimation;reproduced data values;underestimation;prototypical square;wide aspect ratio;tall aspect ratio;bar marks","","4","","36","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1816511,CNS-1647200,OAC-1657364,OAC-1845962,OAC-1910469); Wayne State University Subaward(grant numbers:4207299A,CNS-1821962); NIH(grant numbers:1R56AG060822-01A1,1R44HL145826-01A1,ZJNSF LZ16F020002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972353); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222053","Deep neural network;3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization;maximum intensity projection (MIP);joint embedding","Three-dimensional displays;Image segmentation;Two dimensional displays;Data visualization;Deep learning;Rendering (computer graphics);Feature extraction","biomedical MRI;blood vessels;convolutional neural nets;data visualisation;diseases;feature extraction;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;rendering (computer graphics)","VC-Net;deep volume-composition networks;sparse image;noisy image;cerebrovasculature data;3D vessel structure;end-to-end deep learning;image composition;maximum intensity projection;volume visualization;volume rendering;3D volume images;3D data exploration;MIP embedding features;local vessel signal;geometric variability;2D feature vectors;3D volume embedding space;vessel connectivity;joint convolutional embedding space;cerebrovascular image datasets;visualization-guided computing;3D volumetric image learning;multistream convolutional neural network;joint volume-composition embedding space;vessel probabilities;sparse 3D microvascular structure;traditional 3D vessel segmentation","Computer Graphics;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Neural Networks, Computer","4","","47","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a centralized matching problem, each agent has a preference list ranking the other agents and a central planner is responsible for matching the agents manually or with an algorithm. While algorithms can find a matching which optimizes some performance metrics, they are used as a black box and preclude the central planner from applying his domain knowledge to find a matching which aligns better with the user tasks. Furthermore, the existing matching visualization techniques (i.e. bipartite graph and adjacency matrix) fail in helping the central planner understand the differences between matchings. In this paper, we present VisMatchmaker, a visualization system which allows the central planner to explore alternatives to an algorithm-generated matching.

Event sequence data is widely collected from many real-world processes, such as electronic health records, web clickstreams, and financial transactions, which transmit a great deal of information reflecting the causal relations among event types. Unfortunately, recovering causalities from observational event sequences is challenging, as the heterogeneous and high-dimensional event variables are often connected to rather complex underlying event excitation mechanisms that are hard to infer from limited observations. Many existing automated causal analysis techniques suffer from poor explainability and fail to include an adequate amount of human knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics method for recovering causalities in event sequence data. We extend the Granger causality analysis algorithm on Hawkes processes to incorporate user feedback into causal model refinement. The visualization system includes an interactive causal analysis framework that supports bottom-up causal exploration, iterative causal verification and refinement, and causal comparison through a set of novel visualizations and interactions. We report two forms of evaluation: a quantitative evaluation of the model improvements resulting from the user-feedback mechanism, and a qualitative evaluation through case studies in different application domains to demonstrate the usefulness of the system.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030465","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:22120190216); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222294","Event sequence data;causality analysis;visual analytics","Analytical models;Visual analytics;Data visualization;Data models;Layout;Computational modeling","Bayes methods;causality;data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;interactive systems;iterative methods","observational event sequences;heterogeneous event variables;high-dimensional event variables;event excitation mechanisms;event sequence data;Granger causality analysis algorithm;causal model refinement;visualization system;interactive causal analysis framework;bottom-up causal exploration;iterative causal verification;visual causality analysis;causal relations;Hawkes processes;user feedback","","4","","53","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The primary cause of urban traffic congestion is that the number of vehicles is higher than the permissible limit of the road. Previous studies have focused on dispersing traffic volume by detecting urban traffic congestion zones and predicting future trends. However, to solve the fundamental problem, it is necessary to discover the cause of traffic congestion. Nevertheless, it is difficult to find a research which presents an approach to identify the causes of traffic congestion. In this paper, we propose a technique to analyze the cause of traffic congestion based on the traffic flow theory. We extract vehicle flows from traffic data, such as GPS trajectory and Vehicle Detector data. We detect vehicle flow changes utilizing the entropy from the information theory. Then, we build cumulative vehicle count curves (N-curve) that can quantify the flow of the vehicles in the traffic congestion area. The N-curves are classified into four different traffic congestion patterns by a convolutional neural network. Analyzing the causes and influence of traffic congestion is difficult and requires considerable experience and knowledge. Therefore, we present a visual analytics system that can efficiently perform a series of processes to analyze the cause and influence of traffic congestion. Through case studies, we have evaluated that our system can classify the causes of traffic congestion and can be used efficiently in road planning.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2940580","Textitute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(grant numbers:2019-0-00136,2019-0-00374,2019-0-00795); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827957","Causes of traffic congestion;traffic flow theory;information entropy;convolutional neural network;visual analytics","Roads;Visual analytics;Trajectory;Global Positioning System;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Data visualization","data visualisation;pattern classification;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","traffic congestion cause;visual cause analytics;future trends prediction;urban traffic congestion zones;traffic congestion patterns;traffic congestion area;traffic flow theory","","4","","95","IEEE","10 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for distributed data management for simultaneous interactive navigation and modification of massive 3D data using the readily available infrastructure of a tiled display. Tiled multi-displays, projection or LCD panel based, driven by a PC cluster, can be viewed as a cluster of storage-compute-display (SCD) nodes. Given a cluster of SCD node infrastructure, we first propose a distributed memory hierarchy for interactive rendering applications. Second, in order to further reduce the latency in such applications, we propose a new data partitioning approach for distributed storage among the SCD nodes that reduces the variance in the data load across the SCD nodes. Our data distribution method takes in a data set of any size, and reorganizes it into smaller partitions, and stores it across the multiple SCD nodes. These nodes store, manage, and coordinate data with other SCD nodes to simultaneously achieve interactive navigation and modification. Specifically, the data is not duplicated across these distributed secondary storage devices. In addition, coherency in data access, due to screen-space adjacency of adjacent displays in the tile, as well as object space adjacency of the data sets, is well leveraged in the design of the data management technique. Empirical evaluation on two large data sets, with different data density distribution, demonstrates that the proposed data management approach achieves superior performance over alternative state-of-the-art methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2398439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027856","Management of computing and information systems;project and people management;life cycle;the computing profession miscellaneous ethics","Rendering (computer graphics);Distributed databases;Data models;Navigation;Layout;Three-dimensional displays;Memory management","distributed memory systems;interactive devices;liquid crystal displays;rendering (computer graphics);solid modelling;storage management","data density distribution;data management technique;object space adjacency;screen-space adjacency;secondary storage devices;interactive rendering applications;SCD node infrastructure;storage-compute-display nodes;PC cluster;LCD panel;tiled multidisplays;simultaneous interactive navigation;distributed data management;interactive out-of-core rendering performance;data layout;repeated data edits;massive 3D models;simultaneous modification;tiled display walls;interactive scene navigation;distributed memory hierarchy","","3","","31","IEEE","30 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the conventional remote visualization (CRV) approach of sending a new image from the server to the client for every view parameter change suffers from reduced interactivity. One problem is high latency, as the network has to be traversed twice, once to communicate the view parameters to the server and once to transmit the new image to the client. A second problem is reduced image quality due to aggressive compression or low resolution. We address these problems by constructing and transmitting enhanced images that are sufficient for quality output frame reconstruction at the client for a range of view parameter values. The client reconstructs thousands of frames locally, without any additional data from the server, which avoids latency and aggressive compression. We introduce animated depth images, which not only store a color and depth sample at every pixel, but also store the trajectory of the samples for a given time interval. Sample trajectories are stored compactly by partitioning the image into semi-rigid sample clusters and by storing one sequence of rigid body transformations per cluster. Animated depth images leverage sample trajectory coherence to achieve a good compression of animation data, with a small and user-controllable approximation error. We demonstrate animated depth images in the context of finite element analysis and SPH data sets.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671915","Remote visualization;time-varying data sets;animation data compression;rigid-body decomposition;bounded error","Trajectory;Image reconstruction;Image color analysis;Approximation methods;Data visualization;Rendering (computer graphics)","computer animation;data visualisation;finite element analysis;image processing;mobile computing","SPH data sets;finite element analysis;user controllable approximation error;animation data;trajectory coherence;parameter values;quality output frame reconstruction;image enhancement;image quality;CRV;conventional remote visualization;tablet;laptop;smartphone mobile computing platforms;computer network performance;time-varying data sets;interactive remote visualization;animated depth images","","3","","46","IEEE","21 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, methods for generating graphic layouts have progressed, particularly with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, the problem of specifying the locations and sizes of design elements usually involves constraints with respect to element attributes, such as area, aspect ratio and reading-order. Automating attribute conditional graphic layouts remains a complex and unsolved problem. In this article, we introduce Attribute-conditioned Layout GAN to incorporate the attributes of design elements for graphic layout generation by forcing both the generator and the discriminator to meet attribute conditions. Due to the complexity of graphic designs, we further propose an element dropout method to make the discriminator look at partial lists of elements and learn their local patterns. In addition, we introduce various loss designs following different design principles for layout optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed method can synthesize graphic layouts conditioned on different element attributes. It can also adjust well-designed layouts to new sizes while retaining elements' original reading-orders. The effectiveness of our method is validated through a user study.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.2999335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9106863","Generative adversarial networks;graphic design;attribute","Layout;Generators;Generative adversarial networks;Optimization;Task analysis;Gallium nitride","computer graphics;integrated circuit layout;neural nets;optimisation","element attributes;layout optimization;design principles;element dropout method;graphic layout generation;attribute conditional graphic layouts;generative adversarial networks;modeling layout;automatic graphic design;attribute-conditioned layout GAN","","3","","34","IEEE","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, recently proposed dual-event alignment techniques have not been empirically evaluated. In this work, we designed tasks around temporal event sequence and timing analysis and conducted a controlled experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to examine four sentinel event alignment approaches: no sentinel event alignment (NoAlign), single-event alignment (SingleAlign), dual-event alignment with left justification (DualLeft), and dual-event alignment with stretch justification (DualStretch). Differences between approaches were most pronounced with more rows of data. For understanding intermediate events between two sentinel events, dual-event alignment was the clear winner for correctness-71% vs. 18% for NoAlign and SingleAlign. For understanding the duration between two sentinel events, NoAlign was the clear winner: correctness-88% vs. 36% for DualStretch- completion time-55 seconds vs. 101 seconds for DualLeft-and error-1.5% vs. 8.4% for DualStretch.

We demonstrate our method on a variety of examples and show that it achieves results similar to conventional layout synthesis based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) state-search, but is faster by at least an order of magnitude and can handle layouts of unprecedented size as well as tightly-packed layouts that can overwhelm McMC.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2866436","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1565978); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443151","Automatic layout synthesis;3D scene modeling;automatic content creation;position-based methods;constraints","Layout;Content management;Probabilistic logic;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling","integrated circuit layout;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;optimisation","interior design professionals;aesthetic constraints;functional constraints;nonlinear;stochastic optimization scheme;layout configurations;continuous layout synthesis technique;conventional layout synthesis;Markov chain Monte Carlo state-search;tightly-packed layouts","","3","","42","IEEE","21 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We develop a multi-domain architecture, where the generator consists of a shared encoder and multiple decoders for different cartoon styles, along with multiple discriminators for individual styles.

However, matrices-similar to node-link diagrams-are most effective if their layout reveals the underlying data topology. Given the many developed algorithms, a practical problem arises: âWhich matrix reordering algorithm should I choose for my dataset at hand?â To make matters worse, different reordering algorithms applied to the same dataset may let significantly different visual matrix patterns emerge. This leads to the question of trustworthiness and explainability of these fully automated, often heuristic, black-box processes. We present GUIRO, a Visual Analytics system that helps novices, network analysts, and algorithm designers to open the black-box. Users can investigate the usefulness and expressiveness of 70 accessible matrix reordering algorithms. For network analysts, we introduce a novel model space representation and two interaction techniques for a user-guided reordering of rows or columns, and especially groups thereof (submatrix reordering). These novel techniques contribute to the understanding of the global and local dataset topology. We support algorithm designers by giving them access to 16 reordering quality metrics and visual exploration means for comparing reordering implementations on a row/column permutation level. We evaluated GUIRO in a guided explorative user study with 12 subjects, a case study demonstrating its usefulness in a real-world scenario, and through an expert study gathering feedback on our design decisions. We found that our proposed methods help even inexperienced users to understand matrix patterns and allow a user-guided steering of reordering algorithms. GUIRO helps to increase the transparency of matrix reordering algorithms, thus helping a broad range of users to get a better insight into the complex reordering process, in turn supporting data and reordering algorithm insights.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807245","Visual Analytics;matrix;black-box algorithms;seriation;ordering;sorting;steerable algorithm;interaction;2D projection","Visualization;Data visualization;Indexes;Topology;Measurement;Task analysis;Partitioning algorithms","data analysis;data visualisation;interactive systems;matrix algebra;topology","GUIRO;user-guided matrix reordering;matrix representations;visualization techniques;relational data;data topology;matrix reordering algorithm;visual analytics system;submatrix reordering;visual exploration;user-guided steering;visual matrix patterns;dataset topology;interaction techniques","","3","","85","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our work addresses the scarcity of techniques for visualizing a large number of data-dimensions in an effective and space-efficient manner. We have mapped the full data-space onto a 2D regular polygonal region. The polygon is cut hierarchically with lines parallel to a user-controlled, ordered sequence of sides, each representing a dimension. We have used multiple visual cues such as orientation, thickness, color, countable glyphs, and text to depict cross-dimensional information. We have added interactivity and hierarchical browsing to facilitate flexible exploration of the display: small areas can be scrutinized for details. Thus, our method is also easily extendable to visualize hierarchical information. Our glyph animations add an engaging aesthetic during interaction.

To address these issues, we investigated a novel way of handling visual aggregation with a task-driven and user-centered approach. Given a graph, our approach produces a decluttered view as follows: first, the user investigates different edge bundling results and specifies areas, where certain edge bundling techniques would provide user-desired results. Second, our system then computes a smooth and structural preserving transition between these specified areas. Lastly, the user can further fine-tune the global visualization with a direct manipulation technique to remove the local ambiguity and to apply different visual deformations. In this paper, we provide details for our design rationale and implementation. Also, we show how our algorithm gives more suitable results compared to current edge bundling techniques, and in the end, we provide concrete instances of usages, where the algorithm combines various edge bundling results to support diverse data exploration and visualizations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934805","NSFC(grant numbers:61772315,61861136012); NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund(grant numbers:U1501255); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:J-CYJ20170413162617606); Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region(grant numbers:CUHK 14203416); ANR(grant numbers:ANR-14-CE24-0006-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807234","path visualization;trajectory visualization;edge bundles","Layout;Data visualization;Visualization;Task analysis;Strain;Smoothing methods;Optimization","data analysis;data visualisation;decision making;graph theory","specified areas;edge bundling visualizations;visual aggregation;visual aggregation;efficient aggregated visualizations;user ability;decision making;data visualization;data simplification;interactive structure-aware blending;support diverse data exploration;current edge bundling techniques;direct manipulation technique;global visualization;structural preserving transition;smooth preserving transition;decluttered view;user-centered approach","","3","","55","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These tools allow data analysts to represent multidimensional data in a 2D or 3D space, while preserving as much relevant information as possible. Yet, they cannot preserve all structures simultaneously and they induce some unavoidable distortions. Hence, many criteria have been introduced to evaluate a map's overall quality, mostly based on the preservation of neighbourhoods. Such global indicators are currently used to compare several maps, which helps to choose the most appropriate mapping method and its hyperparameters. However, those aggregated indicators tend to hide the local repartition of distortions. Thereby, they need to be supplemented by local evaluation to ensure correct interpretation of maps.In this paper, we describe a new method, called MING, for ""Map Interpretation using Neighbourhood Graphs"". It offers a graphical interpretation of pairs of map quality indicators, as well as local evaluation of the distortions. This is done by displaying on the map the nearest neighbours graphs computed in the data space and in the embedding. Shared and unshared edges exhibit reliable and unreliable neighbourhood information conveyed by the mapping. By this mean, analysts may determine whether proximity (or remoteness) of points on the map faithfully represents similarity (or dissimilarity) of original data, within the meaning of a chosen map quality criteria. We apply this approach to two pairs of widespread indicators: precision/recall and trustworthiness/continuity, chosen for their wide use in the community, which will allow an easy handling by users.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933568","EvaluationâQualitative Evaluation;Non-Spatial Data and TechniquesâDimensionality Reduction;Visual Analysis and Knowledge DiscoveryâVisual Knowledge Discovery","Distortion;Reliability;Image color analysis;Data visualization;Visualization;Dimensionality reduction;Three-dimensional displays","data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory","local evaluation;correct interpretation;map interpretation;graphical interpretation;map quality indicators;data space;unreliable neighbourhood information;widespread indicators;visual data exploration;dimensionality reduction methods;data analysts;multidimensional data;unavoidable distortions;global indicators;mapping method;aggregated indicators;local repartition;neighbourhood graphs;MING;map quality criteria","","3","","22","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nowadays, the coordination between the muscles to generate simple movements is still not well understood, hindering the knowledge of how to best treat patients with this type of peripheral nerve injury. To acquire enough information for medical data analysis, physicians conduct motion analysis assessments with patients to produce a rich dataset of electromyographic signals from multiple muscles recorded with joint movements during real-world tasks. However, tools for the analysis and visualization of the data in a succinct and interpretable manner are currently not available. Without the ability to integrate, compare, and compute multiple data sources in one platform, physicians can only compute simple statistical values to describe patient's behavior vaguely, which limits the possibility to answer clinical questions and generate hypotheses for research. To address this challenge, we have developed MOTION BROWSER, an interactive visual analytics system which provides an efficient framework to extract and compare muscle activity patterns from the patient's limbs and coordinated views to help users analyze muscle signals, motion data, and video information to address different tasks. The system was developed as a result of a collaborative endeavor between computer scientists and orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation physicians. We present case studies showing physicians can utilize the information displayed to understand how individuals coordinate their muscles to initiate appropriate treatment and generate new hypotheses for future research.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934280","National Aeronautics and Space Administration; NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1229185,CCF-1533564,CNS-1544753,CNS-1626098,CNS-1730396,CNS-1828576,302643/2013-3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809920","Medical Data Visualization;Visual Analytics Application;Time Series Data;Multimodal Data;Brachial Plexus Injuries","Muscles;Data visualization;Brachytherapy;Time series analysis;Task analysis;Visual analytics","biomechanics;data analysis;data visualisation;diseases;electromyography;injuries;medical information systems;medical signal processing;muscle;neurophysiology;orthopaedics;patient rehabilitation;surgery","muscle activity patterns;coordinated views;muscle signals;motion data;video information;computer scientists;interactive visual analytics system;MOTION BROWSER;clinical questions;simple statistical values;multiple data sources;interpretable manner;succinct manner;visualization;real-world tasks;joint movements;multiple muscles;electromyographic signals;rich dataset;motion analysis assessments;medical data analysis;peripheral nerve injury;simple movements;peripheral nerves;complex network;obstetrical brachial plexus injuries;complex upper limb movement;motion browser;rehabilitation physicians;orthopedic surgery","","3","","48","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current automatic network visualization tools focus on debugging the network itself and are not ideal for generating publication visualizations. Therefore, we present an approach to automate this process by translating network architectures specified in Keras into visualizations that can directly be embedded into any publication. To do so, we propose a visual grammar for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which has been derived from an analysis of such figures extracted from all ICCV and CVPR papers published between 2013 and 2019. The proposed grammar incorporates visual encoding, network layout, layer aggregation, and legend generation. We have further realized our approach in an online system available to the community, which we have evaluated through expert feedback, and a quantitative study.

Traditional methods based on spatial sampling can be time-consuming and may not be able to identify all the symmetry planes. In this article, we present a novel learning framework to automatically discover global planar reflective symmetry of a 3D shape. Our framework trains an unsupervised 3D convolutional neural network to extract global model features and then outputs possible global symmetry parameters, where input shapes are represented using voxels. We introduce a dedicated symmetry distance loss along with a regularization loss to avoid generating duplicated symmetry planes. Our network can also identify generalized cylinders by predicting their rotation axes. We further provide a method to remove invalid and duplicated planes and axes. We demonstrate that our method is able to produce reliable and accurate results.

First and foremost, this ability depends on perceptual discriminability; observers must be able to see the difference between different colors for those colors to communicate different meanings. However, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic discriminability, the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts, based on the visual features and concepts alone (i.e., without help from verbal cues such as legends or labels). Previous evidence suggested that observers were better at interpreting encoding systems that maximized semantic discriminability (maximizing association strength between assigned colors and concepts while minimizing association strength between unassigned colors and concepts), compared to a system that only maximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing semantic discriminability also resulted in increased perceptual distance, so it is unclear which factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present study, we conducted two experiments that tested for independent effects of semantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability of bar graph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was large enough to ensure colors were more than just noticeably different. We found that increasing semantic distance improved performance, independent of variation in perceptual distance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated, responses were dominated by semantic distance. These results have implications for navigating trade-offs in color palette design optimization for visual communication.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239918","Visual Reasoning;Information Visualization;Visual Communication;Visual Encoding;Color Perception;Color Cognition","Semantics;Color;Visualization;Observers;Image color analysis;Data visualization;Encoding","data visualisation;encoding;graph theory","perceptual discriminability;semantic discriminability;visual features;encoding systems;association strength;perceptual distance;bar graph data visualizations;visual communication;information visualizations;semantic distance","","3","","41","IEEE","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Research on staging animated transitions in dynamic networks has focused more on offline data, where rendering strategies can take into account past and future states of the network. Rendering online dynamic networks is a more challenging problem since it requires a balance between timeliness for monitoring tasks-so that the animations do not lag too far behind the events-and clarity for comprehension tasks-to minimize simultaneous changes that may be difficult to follow. To illustrate the challenges placed by these requirements, we explore three strategies to stage animations for online dynamic networks: time-based, event-based, and a new hybrid approach that we introduce by combining the advantages of the first two. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in representing low- and high-throughput data and conduct a user study involving monitoring and comprehension of dynamic networks. We also conduct a follow-up, think-aloud study combining monitoring and comprehension with experts in dynamic network visualization. Our findings show that animation staging strategies that emphasize comprehension do better for participant response times and accuracy. However, the notion of âcomprehensionâ is not always clear when it comes to complex changes in highly dynamic networks, requiring some iteration in staging that the hybrid approach affords.

However, the global nature of many topological structures makes their computation challenging at scale, and thus often limits the size of data that can be processed. One key quality to achieving scalability and performance on modern architectures is data locality, i.e., a process operates on data that resides in a nearby memory system, avoiding frequent jumps in data access patterns. From this perspective, topological computations are particularly challenging because the implied data structures represent features that can span the entire data set, often requiring a global traversal phase that limits their scalability. Traditionally, expensive preprocessing is considered an acceptable trade-off as it accelerates all subsequent queries. Most published use cases, however, explore only a fraction of all possible queries, most often those returning small, local features. In these cases, much of the global information is not utilized, yet computing it dominates the overall response time. We address this challenge for merge trees, one of the most commonly used topological structures. In particular, we propose an alternative representation, the merge forest, a collection of local trees corresponding to regions in a domain decomposition. Local trees are connected by a bridge set that allows us to recover any necessary global information at query time. The resulting system couples (i) a preprocessing that scales linearly in practice with (ii) fast runtime queries that provide the same functionality as traditional queries of a global merge tree. We test the scalability of our approach on a shared-memory parallel computer and demonstrate how data structure locality enables the analysis of large data with an order of magnitude performance improvement over the status quo. Furthermore, a merge forest reduces the memory overhead compared to a global merge tree and enables the processing of data sets that are an order of magnitude larger than possible with previous algorithms.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934257","NSF(grant numbers:1314896,1602127,1649923,1842042); DOE/SciDAC(grant numbers:DESC0007446); PSAAP CCMSC(grant numbers:DE-NA0002375); Intel Graphics and Visualization; Institutes of XeLLENCE program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794560","Merge tree;parallel computation;topology","Vegetation;Forestry;Feature extraction;Data structures;Scalability;Acceleration;Task analysis","data analysis;query processing;shared memory systems;telecommunication network topology;tree data structures","localized topological data structures;data sets;data structure locality;shared-memory parallel computer;query time;necessary global information;local trees;local features;possible queries;global traversal phase;implied data structures;topological computations;data access patterns;nearby memory system;data locality;scalar data;intrinsic features;complex questions;data analysis","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Databases, Factual;Foot Bones;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","3","","48","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While most of these tools have focused on exploring novel techniques to manually specify visualizations, recent touch-based visualization systems have begun to explore interface and interaction techniques for attribute-based visualization recommendations as a way to aid users (particularly novices) during data exploration. Advancing this line of work, we present a visualization system, VisWall, that enables visual data exploration in both single user and co-located collaborative settings on large touch displays. Coupling the concepts of direct combination and derivable visualizations, VisWall enables rapid construction of multivariate visualizations using attributes of previously created visualizations. By blending visualization recommendations and naturalistic interactions, VisWall seeks to help users visually explore their data by allowing them to focus more on aspects of the data (particularly, data attributes) rather than specifying and reconfiguring visualizations. We discuss the design, interaction techniques, and operations employed by VisWall along with a scenario of how these can be used to facilitate various tasks during visual data exploration.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933673","Human-centered computing;Visualization","Data visualization;Motion pictures;Visualization;Tools;Histograms;Tiles;Strips","data visualisation;touch sensitive screens","VisWall;visual data exploration;touch displays;derivable visualizations;multivariate visualizations;data attributes;interaction techniques;data visualization tools;touch-based devices;touch-based visualization systems;attribute-based visualization recommendations;data visualization tools","","3","","37","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To obtain high quality color images, a better approach is to colorize the gray images from the monochrome camera with the color images from the color camera serving as a reference. In addition, the colorization may fail in some cases, which makes the estimation of the colorization quality a necessary step before outputting the colorization result. To solve these problems, we propose a deep convolutional network based framework. 1) In the colorization module, the proposed colorization CNN uses deep feature representations, attention operation, 3-D regulation and color correction to make use of colors of multiple pixels in the reference image for colorizing each pixel in the input gray image. 2) In the colorization quality estimation module, based on the symmetry property of colorization, we propose to utilize the colorization CNN again to colorize the gray map of the original reference color image using the first-time colorization result from the colorization module as reference. Then, the quality loss of the second-time colorization result can be used for estimating the colorization quality. Experimental results show that our method can largely outperform the state-of-the-art colorization methods and estimate the colorization quality accurately as well.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3022480","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802026,61806016); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019RC39); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9188002","Colorization CNN;weight volume;color correction;colorization quality estimation","Image color analysis;Color;Estimation;Cameras;Feature extraction;Lenses;Training","cameras;feature extraction;image colour analysis","high quality color images;gray images;monochrome camera;color camera;deep convolutional network based framework;colorization module;colorization CNN;color correction;reference image;input gray image;colorization quality estimation module;original reference color image;first-time colorization result;second-time colorization result;state-of-the-art colorization methods;colorization framework;monochrome-color dual-lens systems","","2","","38","IEEE","8 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our adaptive sampling approach varies probe density based on a novel âlocal diameterâ measure of the space surrounding a given point, evaluated by stochastically tracing paths in the scene. We apply this measure to layout probes so as to smoothly adapt resolution and eliminate undersampling in corners, narrow corridors and stairways, while coarsening appropriately in more open areas.

As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure.

For maximum flexibility with large datasets, a stretch and squish navigation algorithm should allow for millions of potentially deformable regions. However, typical usage only changes the extents of a small subset k of these n regions at a time. The challenge is to avoid computations that are linear in n, because a single deformation can affect the absolute screen-space location of every deformable region.

One widely applicable model for how humans under-stand data is descriptive rules, which can characterize important attributes and simultaneously their crucial values or ranges. In this paper, we introduce an approach to help with data understanding via interactively and automatically generated rules. Our approach makes discerning the behavior of groups of interesting data efficient and simple by bridging the gap between machine learning methods for rule learning and the user experience of sensemaking through visual exploration. We have evaluated our approach with machine learning experiments to confirm an existing rule learning algorithm performs well in this interactive context even with a small amount of user input, and created a prototype system, DRIL (Descriptive Rules by Interactive Learning), to demonstrate its capability through a case study.","","978-1-7281-8014-4","10.1109/VIS47514.2020.00058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331309","human-in-the-loop;data characterization;rule learning","Visualization;Machine learning algorithms;Prototypes;Machine learning;Tools;User experience;Stakeholders","data analysis;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);user experience","rule learning;user experience;DRIL;data analysis;human-in-the-loop approach;semantic interaction tools;machine learning;Descriptive Rules by Interactive Learning;sensemaking;visual exploration","","2","","41","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and qualitative feedback collected, and note areas for improvement and room for future work.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030464","NSERC(grant numbers:RGPIN-2018-05072); University of Toronto FA&S Tri-Council Bridge Funding; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222251","Visualization Literacy;Educational technology;Gamification;Narrative","Data visualization;Games;Education;Visualization;Computer science;Tools;Probes","computer aided instruction;data visualisation;human computer interaction;serious games (computing)","educational tools;visualization community;meaningful visualizations;visualization literacy skills;education research;young children;designing narrative-focused role-playing games;graph-reading skills;additional narrative elements;between-subjects study design;education science;game design;design considerations;role-playing game-based designs;early education","Adolescent;Child;Child, Preschool;Computer Graphics;Gamification;Humans;Learning;Literacy;Narration;Video Games","2","","92","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper evaluates balance recovery methods and intervention timing during the use of VR with the assumption that the onset of a fall is given. Our experiment followed the tether-release protocol during clinical research and induced a fall while a subject was engaged in a secondary 3D object selection task. The experiment employed a two-by-two design that evaluated two assistive techniques, i.e., video-see-through and auditory warning at two different timings, i.e., at fall onset and 500ms prior to fall onset. The data from 17 subjects showed that video-see-through triggered 500 ms before the onset of fall can effectively help users recover from falls. Surprisingly, video-see-through at fall onset has a significant negative impact on balance recovery and produces similar results to those of the baseline condition (no intervention).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2927477","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP180100670,DP180100656); NSW Defence Innovation Network; NSW State Government of Australia(grant numbers:DINPP2019 S1-03/09); Office of Naval Research Global(grant numbers:N62909-19-1-2058); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758372","VR;fall;balance","Protocols;Virtual environments;Three-dimensional displays;Australia;Legged locomotion;Timing;Resists","helmet mounted displays;virtual reality","virtual environment;balance recovery methods;intervention timing;VR;tether-release protocol;clinical research;secondary 3D object selection task;balance recovery techniques;head-mounted display;room-scale 3D position tracking;video-see-through","Accidental Falls;Adult;Computer Graphics;Female;Humans;Male;Postural Balance;Smart Glasses;Virtual Reality;Walking;Young Adult","2","","50","IEEE","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are currently no previous studies to adequately address this problem. This paper presents an evaluation study that investigates the effects of background stories on graph perception. We formulate three hypotheses on different aspects including visual focus areas, graph structure identification, and mental model formation, and design three controlled experiments to test our hypotheses using real-world graphs with background stories. We analyze our experimental data to compare the performance of participants who have read and not read the background stories, and obtain a set of instructive findings. First, our results show that knowing the background stories affects participants focus areas in interactive graph exploration to a certain extent. Second, it significantly affects the performance of identifying community structures but not high degree and bridge structures.

We find that participants exhibited lower JNDs with a diverging (cool-warm) or a spectral (rainbow) scheme, as compared with a monotonic-luminance colormap (viridis).

However, it is not clear whether non-isomorphic rotation can benefit 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) manipulation tasks in AR and VR. In this article, we extended the usability studies of non-isomorphic rotation from rotation-only tasks to 6-DOF manipulation tasks and analyzed the collected data using a 2-component model. Using a mixed reality (MR) simulation approach, we also investigated whether environment (AR or VR) had an impact on 3D manipulation tasks. The results reveal that although both static and dynamic non-isomorphic rotation techniques could save time and effort in ballistic phases, only dynamic non-isomorphic rotation was significantly faster than isomorphic rotation. Interestingly, while environment had no significant impact on overall user performance, we found evidence that it could affect fine-tuning in correction phases. We also found that most participants preferred AR over VR, indicating that environmental visual realism could be helpful to improve user experience.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3010247","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872104); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:F2016028); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3072020CF0603); PCL Future Greater-Bay Area Network Facilities for Large-scale Experiments and Applications(grant numbers:LZC0019); Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Networking; Tianjin University(grant numbers:300350); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9144483","Virtual reality;augmented reality;mixed reality simulation;3D interaction;non-isomorphic rotation","Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality;Solid modeling;User interfaces;Usability;Manipulator dynamics","augmented reality;computer displays;data visualisation;ergonomics;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;human factors;interactive systems;touch sensitive screens","rotation tasks;nonisomorphic rotation techniques;isomorphic rotation;3D user interfaces;hyper-natural interaction technique;mixed reality simulation","","2","","53","IEEE","20 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus it can help new developers, managers, and testers understand the history of development without needing to dig into a large pile of unfamiliar source code. However, the current tools for Git visualization are not adequate to analyze and explore the metadata: They focus mainly on improving the usability of Git commands instead of on helping users understand the development history. Furthermore, they do not scale for large and complex Git commit graphs, which can play an important role in understanding the overall development history. In this paper, we present Githru, an interactive visual analytics system that enables developers to effectively understand the context of development history through the interactive exploration of Git metadata. We design an interactive visual encoding idiom to represent a large Git graph in a scalable manner while preserving the topological structures in the Git graph. To enable scalable exploration of a large Git commit graph, we propose novel techniques (graph reconstruction, clustering, and Context-Preserving Squash Merge (CSM) methods) to abstract a large-scale Git commit graph. Based on these Git commit graph abstraction techniques, Githru provides an interactive summary view to help users gain an overview of the development history and a comparison view in which users can compare different clusters of commits. The efficacy of Githru has been demonstrated by case studies with domain experts using real-world, in-house datasets from a large software development team at a major international IT company. A controlled user study with 12 developers comparing Githru to previous tools also confirms the effectiveness of Githru in terms of task completion time.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222261","git;history;exploration;overview;repository;visualization;cluster;DAG","History;Metadata;Software;Visualization;Interviews;Tools;Complexity theory","data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;meta data;program visualisation;software engineering","Githru;software development team;software development history;Git metadata;software development project;Git visualization;Git commands;complex Git commit graphs;interactive visual analytics system;interactive visual encoding idiom;Git commit graph abstraction techniques;visual analytics","Computer Graphics;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Metadata;Software","2","","75","CCBY","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given an example circular glyph and multidimensional input data, GlyphCreator promptly generates a list of design candidates, any of which can be edited to satisfy the requirements of a particular representation. To develop GlyphCreator, we first derive a design space of circular glyphs by summarizing relationships between different visual elements. With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning model for glyph parsing. The model can deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into a series of visual elements. Next, we introduce an interface that helps users bind the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles.

This results in a complex and interconnected mesh that is difficult to represent and impractical to interpret using conventional visualization techniques. We develop a bi-modal visualization framework, leveraging graph-based and geometry-based techniques to achieve interactive visualization of microvascular networks. This framework allows researchers to objectively interpret the complex and subtle variations that arise when comparing microvascular networks.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933682","microvascular;graph;network;bi-modal visualization","Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Layout;Diseases;Rendering (computer graphics);Cameras;Complexity theory","blood vessels;data visualisation;diseases;geometry;graph theory;medical image processing;rendering (computer graphics)","tissue development;microvascular networks;interconnected mesh;bi-modal visualization framework;interactive visualization techniques;graph-assisted visualization;geometry-based techniques;graph-based technique","","2","","41","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the client may have a considerable amount of hardware available, which is left idle. Further, the visualization is put at the whim of possibly unreliable server and network conditions. Server load, bandwidth and latency may substantially affect the response time on the client. In this paper, we describe a hybrid method, where visualization workload is assigned to server and client. A capable client can produce images independently. The goal is to determine a workload schedule that enables a synergy between the two sides to provide rendering results to the user as fast as possible. The schedule is determined based on processing and transfer timings obtained at runtime. Our probabilistic scheduler adapts to changing conditions by shifting workload between server and client, and accounts for the performance variability in the dynamic system.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2303092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727579","Remote/hybrid rendering;client/server systems;uncertainty;probabilistic scheduling","Servers;Rendering (computer graphics);Timing;Schedules;Data visualization;Hardware;Probabilistic logic","data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics)","hybrid rendering;visualization pipeline;purely server-based approach;capable client;workload schedule;probabilistic scheduler","","2","","29","IEEE","28 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To support such investigations, visual analysis tools use biclustering to mine relationships in bipartite graphs and visualize the resulting biclusters with standard graph visualization techniques. Due to overlaps among biclusters, such visualizations can be cluttered (e.g., with many edge crossings), when there are a large number of biclusters. Prior work attempted to resolve this problem by automatically ordering nodes in a bipartite graph. However, visual clutter is still a serious problem, since the number of displayed biclusters remains unchanged. We propose bicluster aggregation as an alternative approach, and have developed two methods of interactively merging biclusters. These interactive bicluster aggregations help organize similar biclusters and reduce the number of displayed biclusters.

Participating media has a translucent aspect that comes from light being scattered inside the material. For materials with a small mean-free-path (mfp), multiple scattering effects dominate. Simulating these effects is computationally intensive, as it requires tracking a large number of scattering events inside the material. Existing approaches precompute multiple scattering events inside the material and store the results in a table. During rendering time, this table is used to compute the scattering effects. While these methods are faster than explicit scattering computation, they incur higher storage costs. In this paper, we present a new representation for double and multiple scattering effects that uses a neural network model. The scattering response from all homogeneous participating media is encoded into a neural network in a preprocessing step. At run time, the neural network is then used to predict the double and multiple scattering effects. We demonstrate the effects combined with Virtual Ray Lights (VRL), although our approach can be integrated with other rendering algorithms. Our algorithm is implemented on GPU. Double and multiple scattering effects for the entire participating media space are encoded using only 23.6 KB of memory.

In recent years, data-driven methods have demonstrated their robustness and effectiveness with respect to noise and feature properties on a wide variety of geometry and image problems. Most existing mesh denoising methods still use hand-crafted features, and locally denoise facets rather than examine the mesh globally. In this work, we propose the use of a fully end-to-end learning strategy based on graph convolutions, where meaningful features are learned directly by our network. It operates on a graph of facets, directly on the existing topology of the mesh, without resampling, and follows a multi-scale design to extract geometric features at different resolution levels. Similar to most recent pipelines, given a noisy mesh, we first denoise face normals with our novel approach, then update vertex positions accordingly. Our method performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-art learning-based methods.

The proposed system can assist the computational biologists, who designed the simulation model, to visually calibrate the input parameters by modifying the parameter values and immediately visualizing the predicted simulation outcome without having the need to run the original expensive simulation for every instance.

In this work, we demonstrate the advantage of using neural networks as surrogate models for visual analysis by incorporating some of the recent advances in the field of uncertainty quantification, interpretability and explainability of neural network-based models. We utilize the trained network to perform interactive parameter sensitivity analysis of the original simulation as well as recommend optimal parameter configurations using the activation maximization framework of neural networks. We also facilitate detail analysis of the trained network to extract useful insights about the simulation model, learned by the network, during the training process. We performed two case studies, and discovered multiple new parameter configurations, which can trigger high cell polarization results in the original simulation model. We evaluated our results by comparing with the original simulation model outcomes as well as the findings from previous parameter analysis performed by our experts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934591","US Department of Energy; Los Alamos National Laboratory(grant numbers:47145); UT-Battelle LLC(grant numbers:4000159447); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805421","Surrogate modeling;Neural networks;Computational biology;Visual analysis;Parameter analysis","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Visualization;Biological system modeling;Neural networks;Machine learning;Data models","biology computing;computer simulation;data analysis;data visualisation;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","interactive exploratory analysis;trained neural network-based surrogate model;neural networks;interactive parameter sensitivity analysis;neural network assisted visual analysis;complex computational models;yeast cell polarization simulation;backend analysis;computational biologists;NNVA","Computational Biology;Computer Graphics;Models, Biological;Neural Networks, Computer;Yeasts","2","","66","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, existing measures of perceptual precision for data channels (e.g., position, length, orientation, etc.) are based largely on verbal reports of ratio judgments between two values (e.g., [7]). Verbal report conflates multiple sources of error beyond actual visual precision, introducing a ratio computation between these values and a requirement to translate that ratio to a verbal number. Here we observe raw measures of precision by eliminating both ratio computations and verbal reports; we simply ask participants to reproduce marks (a single bar or dot) to match a previously seen one. We manipulated whether the mark was initially presented (and later drawn) alone, paired with a reference (e.g. a second `100%' bar also present at test, or a y-axis for the dot), or integrated with the reference (merging that reference bar into a stacked bar graph, or placing the dot directly on the axis). Reproductions of smaller values were overestimated, and larger values were underestimated, suggesting systematic memory biases. Average reproduction error was around 10% of the actual value, regardless of whether the reproduction was done on a common baseline with the original. In the reference and (especially) the integrated conditions, responses were repulsed from an implicit midpoint of the reference mark, such that values above 50% were overestimated, and values below 50% were underestimated. This reproduction paradigm may serve within a new suite of more fundamental measures of the precision of graphical perception.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030345","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-190); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288884","Cognition and perception;Graphical perception;Perceptual biases;Ratio perception","Bars;Visualization;Data visualization;Task analysis;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Semantics","cognition;data visualisation;visual perception","category repulsion;data reproductions;data visualization;visual extraction;perceptual precision;data channels;verbal report;ratio judgments;visual precision;ratio computation;verbal number;raw measures;reference bar;stacked bar graph;smaller values;systematic memory biases;average reproduction error;reference mark;reproduction paradigm","","2","","41","IEEE","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a novel procedural model called PICO (Procedural Iterative Constrained Optimizer) and PICO-Graph that is the underlying procedural model designed with optimization in mind. The key novelty of PICO is that it enables the exploration of generative designs by combining both user and environmental constraints into a single framework by using optimization without the need to write procedural rules. The PICO-Graph procedural model consists of a set of geometry generating operations and a set of axioms connected in a directed cyclic graph. The forward generation is initiated by a set of axioms that use the connections to send coordinate systems and geometric objects through the PICO-Graph, which in turn generates more objects. This allows for fast generation of complex and varied geometries. Moreover, we combine PICO-Graph with efficient optimization that allows for quick exploration of the generated models and the generation of variants. The user defines the rules, the axioms, and the set of constraints; for example, whether an existing object should be supported by the generated model, whether symmetries exist, whether the object should spin, etc. PICO then generates a class of geometric models and optimizes them so that they fulfill the constraints. The generation and the optimization in our implementation provides interactive user control during model execution providing continuous feedback. For example, the user can sketch the constraints and guide the geometry to meet these specified goals. We show PICO on a variety of examples such as the generation of procedural chairs with multiple supports, generation of support structures for 3D printing, generation of spinning objects, or generation of procedural terrains matching a given input. Our framework could be used as a component in a larger design workflow; its strongest application is in the early rapid ideation and prototyping phases.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.2995556","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:#10001387); Functional Proceduralization of 3D Geometric Models; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095367","Computational geometry and object modeling;three-dimensional graphics and realism","Optimization;Geometry;Shape;Computational modeling;Grammar;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling","computational geometry;directed graphs;graph theory;iterative methods;optimisation;solid modelling","Procedural Iterative Constrained Optimizer;geometry generating operations;axioms;continuous feedback;PICO Graph procedural model;environmental constraints;user constraints;procedural terrains;procedural chairs;execution model;geometric models;forward generation;directed cyclic graph","","2","","70","IEEE","18 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The parameters consist of speed multiplier, direction, contrast type and the global velocity scale. In addition, we investigated if multiple motion cues, and point distribution, affect the speed estimation. Several studies were executed to investigate the impact of each parameter. In the initial results, we noticed trends in scale and multiplier. Using the trends for the significant parameters, we designed a compensation model, which adjusts the particle speed to compensate for the effect of the parameters. We then performed a second study to investigate the performance of the compensation model. From the second study we detected a constant estimation error, which we adjusted for in the last study.

However, clutter and overlap of unrelated structures can lead to confusing graph visualizations. This paper leverages the persistent homology features of an undirected graph as derived information for interactive manipulation of force-directed layouts. We first discuss how to efficiently extract 0-dimensional persistent homology features from both weighted and unweighted undirected graphs. We then introduce the interactive persistence barcode used to manipulate the force-directed graph layout. In particular, the user adds and removes contracting and repulsing forces generated by the persistent homology features, eventually selecting the set of persistent homology features that most improve the layout.

This requires formulating an online variant of the well-known view-planning problem, which must take into account what parts of the scene have already been seen and how the lumigraph sample distribution could improve in the future. We address this highly unconstrained problem by regularizing the scene structure using a regular grid structure. Upon the grid structure, we define a coverage metric describing how well the lumigraph samples cover the grid in terms of spatial and angular resolution, and we greedily keep incoming views if they improve the coverage. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively on a variety of synthetic and real scenes, and demonstrate visually appealing results obtained at real-time frame rates (in the range of 3Hz-100Hz per incoming image, depending on configuration).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794622","Lumigraph;virtual reality;rendering;real-time;view planning;keyframe selection;multi-view","Planning;Image reconstruction;Real-time systems;Geometry;Rendering (computer graphics);Computational modeling;Image color analysis","graph theory;image resolution;image texture;interactive systems;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","time view planning;unstructured lumigraph modeling;image stream;mixed reality;telepresence;interior design;conventional texture optimization;strictly incremental manner;online variant;well-known view-planning problem;lumigraph sample distribution;highly unconstrained problem;scene structure;regular grid structure;lumigraph samples;spatial resolution;angular resolution;incoming views;synthetic scenes;real scenes;real-time frame rates","","2","","51","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rendering a 512 x 512 image of a simple scene can require more than 196 Gbytes of raw bandwidth to the photon map data structure. This bandwidth is a major obstacle to real-time photon mapping. This paper investigates two approaches for reducing the required bandwidth: 1) reordering the <i>k</i>NN searches and 2) cache conscious data structures. Using a Hilbert curve reordering, we demonstrate an experimental lower bound of 15 Mbytes of bandwidth for the same scene. Unfortunately, this improvement of four orders of magnitude requires a prohibitive amount of intermediate storage. We introduce two novel cost-effective algorithms that reduce the bandwidth by one order of magnitude. Scenes of different complexities are shown to exhibit similar reductions in bandwidth. We explain why the choice of data structure does not achieve similar reductions. We also examine the interaction of query reordering with two photon map acceleration techniques, importance sampling, and the irradiance cache. Query reordering exploits the additional coherence that arises from the use of importance sampling in scenes with glossy surfaces. Irradiance caching also benefits from query reordering, even when complex surface geometry reduces the effectiveness of the irradiance cache.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359492","Global Illumination;Photon Mapping;Importance Sampling;Irradiance Caching;Graphics Hardware;Global Illumination;Photon Mapping;Importance Sampling;Irradiance Caching;Graphics Hardware","Bandwidth;Layout;Data structures;Lighting;Casting;Monte Carlo methods;Geometry;Hardware;Rendering (computer graphics);Acceleration","cache storage;data structures;image sampling;rendering (computer graphics)","photon-mapping bandwidth;query reordering;image rendering;photon map data structure;kNN search;Hilbert curve reordering;irradiance cache;importance sampling","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Light;Lighting;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Photometry;Photons;Radiation Dosage;Radiometry;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","2","3","37","","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For real-time collaboration, existing work has primarily focused on synchronizing constituent visualizations - an approach that makes it difficult for users to work independently, or selectively attend to their collaborators' activity. To address this gap, we introduce a design space for representing synchronous multi-user collaboration in visualizations defined by two orthogonal axes: situatedness, or whether collaborators' interactions are overlaid on or shown outside of a user's view, and specificity, or whether collaborators are depicted through abstract, generic representations or through specific means customized for the given visualization. We populate this de-sign space with a variety of examples including generic and custom synchronized cursors, and user legends that collect these cursors together or reproduce collaborators' views as thumbnails. To build common ground, users can interact with these representations by peeking to take a quick look at a collaborator's view, tracking to follow along with a collaborator in real-time, and forking to independently explore the visualization based on a collaborator's work. We present a reference implementation of a wrapper library that converts interactive Vega-Lite charts into collaborative visualizations. We find that our approach affords synchronous collaboration across an expressive range of visual designs and interaction techniques.","","978-1-7281-8014-4","10.1109/VIS47514.2020.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331317","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization systems and tools","Visualization;Collaboration;Prototypes;Switches;Tools;Real-time systems;Synchronization","data visualisation;groupware","shared awareness;collaborative visualization;real-time collaboration;constituent visualizations;collaborators;design space;synchronous multiuser collaboration;abstract representations;generic representations;given visualization;generic cursors;custom synchronized cursors;user legends;visual designs;interaction techniques;real-time multiuser collaboration","","2","","25","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Responsive matrix cells are local zoomable regions of interest that provide auxiliary data exploration and editing facilities for multivariate graphs. They behave responsively by adapting their visual contents to the cell location, the available display space, and the user task. Responsive matrix cells enable users to reveal details about the graph, compare node and edge attributes, and edit data values directly in a matrix without resorting to external views or tools. We report the general design considerations for responsive matrix cells covering the visual and interactive means necessary to support a seamless data exploration and editing.

Creating infographics is a difficult and time-consuming process which often requires significant attempts and adjustments even for experienced designers, not to mention novice users with limited design expertise. Recently, a few approaches have been proposed to automate the creation process by applying predefined blueprints to user information. However, predefined blueprints are often hard to create, hence limited in volume and diversity. In contrast, good infogrpahics have been created by professionals and accumulated on the Internet rapidly. These online examples often represent a wide variety of design styles, and serve as exemplars or inspiration to people who like to create their own infographics. Based on these observations, we propose to generate infographics by automatically imitating examples. We present a two-stage approach, namely retrieve-then-adapt. In the retrieval stage, we index online examples by their visual elements. For a given user information, we transform it to a concrete query by sampling from a learned distribution about visual elements, and then find appropriate examples in our example library based on the similarity between example indexes and the query. For a retrieved example, we generate an initial drafts by replacing its content with user information. However, in many cases, user information cannot be perfectly fitted to retrieved examples. Therefore, we further introduce an adaption stage. Specifically, we propose a MCMC-like approach and leverage recursive neural networks to help adjust the initial draft and improve its visual appearance iteratively, until a satisfactory result is obtained. We implement our approach on widely-used proportion-related infographics, and demonstrate its effectiveness by sample results and expert reviews.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233469","Infographics;automatic visualization","Visualization;Layout;Libraries;Tools;Internet;Indexes;Neural networks","data visualisation;image retrieval;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","example-based automatic generation;data visualization technique;graphic descriptions;textual descriptions;aesthetics;experienced designers;design expertise;creation process;predefined blueprints;online examples;design styles;two-stage approach;retrieval stage;visual elements;user information;example library;example indexes;adaption stage;visual appearance;proportion-related infographics;initial draft generation;retrieve-then-adapt;Internet;MCMC-like approach;recursive neural networks","","2","","38","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We build on existing LSTM technology (long short-term memory) to encode both the sketch and the time series data in a network with shared parameters. We use data from a user study to let the network learn a proper similarity function. We focus our approach on perceived similarities and achieve that the learned model also includes a user-side aspect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-driven solution for querying time series data in visual analytics. Besides evaluating the accuracy and efficiency directly in a quantitative way, we also compare our solution to the recently published Qetch algorithm as well as the commonly used dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3002950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119141","Machine learning;sketch-based interaction;visual analytics;time series data","Time series analysis;Machine learning;Time series analysis;Data visualization;Data models;Heuristic algorithms","data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing;time series","sketch-based fast;accurate querying;parameter-sharing LSTM networks;sketching;time series data;data-driven solution","","2","","46","IEEE","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they face a significant problem influencing the perception and interpretation of patterns. The distance between two parallel lines differs based on their slope. Vertical lines are rendered longer and closer to each other than horizontal lines. This problem is inherent in the technique and has two main consequences: (1) clusters which have a steep slope between two axes are visually more prominent than horizontal clusters. (2) Noise and clutter can be perceived as clusters, as a few parallel vertical lines visually emerge as a ghost cluster. Our paper makes two contributions: First, we formalize the problem and show its impact. Second, we present a novel technique to reduce the effects by rendering the polylines of the parallel coordinates based on their slope: horizontal lines are rendered with the default width, lines with a steep slope with a thinner line. Our technique avoids density distortions of clusters, can be computed in linear time, and can be added on top of most parallel coordinate variations. To demonstrate the usefulness, we show examples and compare them to the classical rendering.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933706","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933706","Parallel coordinates;rendering;density distortion.","Rendering (computer graphics);Distortion;Clutter;Visualization;Distributed databases;Data visualization;Geometry","computational geometry;data visualisation;pattern clustering;rendering (computer graphics)","parallel coordinates;multidimensional data visualization;horizontal lines;ghost cluster;density distortion;slope-dependent rendering;pattern interpretation;vertical lines;polyline rendering","","2","","20","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, sampling strategies have been mostly ad hoc, and evaluation of the resulting approximations has been difficult. In this paper, the structure of penumbral irradiance is investigated empirically and numerically. This study has been made feasible by the use of the discontinuity mesh and the backprojection, an efficient data structure representing visibility in regions of partial occlusion. Regions of penumbrae in which irradiance varies nonmonotonically are characterized empirically, and numerical tests are performed to determine the frequency of their occurrence. This study inspired the development of two algorithms for the construction of interpolating approximations to irradiance: one algorithm reduces the number of edges in the mesh defining the interpolant domain; and the other algorithm chooses among linear, quadratic, and mixed interpolants based on irradiance monotonicity. Results from numerical tests and images are presented that demonstrate good performance of the new algorithms for various realistic test configurations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.556499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=556499","","Lighting;Light sources;Testing;Layout;Sampling methods;Data structures;Frequency;Image sampling;Performance evaluation;Interpolation","brightness;rendering (computer graphics);computational geometry;data structures;interpolation;mesh generation","structured penumbral irradiance computation;computational expense;area light source;sampling strategies;approximations;discontinuity mesh;backprojection;data structure;partial occlusion;numerical tests;interpolating approximations;mixed interpolants;linear interpolants;quadratic interpolants;irradiance monotonicity;performance;rendering;illumination;radiosity","","2","","34","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent research has applied data analytics techniques to analyze and detect tax evasion behaviors of individual taxpayers. However, they have failed to support the analysis and exploration of the related party transaction tax evasion (RPTTE) behaviors (e.g., transfer pricing), where a group of taxpayers is involved. In this paper, we present TaxThemis, an interactive visual analytics system to help tax officers mine and explore suspicious tax evasion groups through analyzing heterogeneous tax-related data. A taxpayer network is constructed and fused with the respective trade network to detect suspicious RPTTE groups. Rich visualizations are designed to facilitate the exploration and investigation of suspicious transactions between related taxpayers with profit and topological data analysis. Specifically, we propose a calendar heatmap with a carefully-designed encoding scheme to intuitively show the evidence of transferring revenue through related party transactions.

Evaluating these clustering techniques, however, is difficult due to the lack of universal ground truth. Instead, clustering approaches are usually evaluated based on a subjective visual judgment of low-dimensional scatterplots of different datasets. As clustering is an inherent human-in-the-loop task, we propose a more systematic way of evaluating clustering algorithms based on quantification of human perception of clusters in 2D scatterplots. The core question we are asking is in how far existing clustering techniques align with clusters perceived by humans. To do so, we build on a dataset from a previous study [1], in which 34 human subjects la-beled 1000 synthetic scatterplots in terms of whether they could see one or more than one cluster. Here, we use this dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art clustering techniques in terms of how far they agree with these human judgments. More specifically, we assess 1437 variants of K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, CLIQUE, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering techniques on these benchmarks data. We get unexpected results. For instance, CLIQUE and DBSCAN are at best in slight agreement on this basic cluster counting task, while model-agnostic Agglomerative clustering can be up to a substantial agreement with human subjects depending on the variants. We discuss how to extend this perception-based clustering benchmark approach, and how it could lead to the design of perception-based clustering techniques that would better support more trustworthy and explainable models of cluster patterns.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933620","H.1.2 [User/Machine Systems]: Human factors;I.5.3 [Clustering]: Algorithms;I.5.2 [Design Methodology]: Pattern analysis","Benchmark testing;Task analysis;Data models;Two dimensional displays;Merging;Visualization;Gaussian mixture model","data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;Gaussian processes;pattern clustering","agglomerative clustering techniques;basic cluster counting task;perception-based clustering;visual analytics;clustering approaches;subjective visual judgment;human-in-the-loop task;clustering algorithms;human perception;perception-based evaluation;model-agnostic agglomerative clustering;k-means clustering;Gaussian mixture models;CLIQUE clustering;DBSCAN clustering","","2","","38","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper attacks this problem following the well known idea of changing the order of the dimensions and introducing ancillary visualizations to mitigate some of RadViz drawbacks. In particular, the paper defines the notion of point optimal disposition of the dimensions for a single data point, generalizes this concept to a set of data points, and proposes effective heuristics for dealing with the intractable problem of exploring all the (n-1)!/2 dispositions of the dimensions along the RadViz circumference.

As a consequence, visualization designers either develop ad hoc solutions that are rarely comprehensive, or do not track provenance at all. In this paper, we introduce a web-based software library - Trrack - that is designed for easy integration in existing or future visualization systems. Trrack supports a wide range of use cases, from simple action recovery, to capturing intent and reasoning, and can be used to share states with collaborators and store provenance on a server.

We present a visual analytics approach to uncover the decision-making process of a CAD system for classifying pancreatic cystic lesions. This CAD algorithm consists of two distinct components: random forest (RF), which classifies a set of predefined features, including demographic features, and a convolutional neural network (CNN), which analyzes radiological (imaging) features of the lesions. We study the class probabilities generated by the RF and the semantical meaning of the features learned by the CNN. We also use an eye tracker to better understand which radiological features are particularly useful for a radiologist to make a diagnosis and to quantitatively compare with the features that lead the CNN to its final classification decision. Additionally, we evaluate the effects and benefits of supplying the CAD system with a case-based visual aid in a second-reader setting.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2947037","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NRT1633299,CNS1650499,OAC1919752); Marcus Foundation; NIH NHLBI(grant numbers:U01HL127522); NY State Center for Biotechnology; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Brookhaven National Laboratory; Feinstein Institute for Medical Research; NY State Dept. of Economic Development(grant numbers:C14051); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8868209","Radiomics;pancreas;abdominal imaging;machine learning;computer-aided diagnosis;cancer","Lesions;Visualization;Solid modeling;Machine learning;Analytical models;Computed tomography;Cancer","convolutional neural nets;data visualisation;decision making;feature extraction;image classification;medical image processing;probability;random forests","computer-aided diagnosis system;pancreatic lesions;machine learning;medical image analysis;CAD system;internal decision process;visual analytics approach;decision-making process;pancreatic cystic lesions;RF;predefined features;demographic features;CNN;radiological features;case-based visual aid","Adult;Algorithms;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Male;Neural Networks, Computer;Pancreas;Pancreatic Neoplasms;Radiography, Abdominal;Young Adult","2","","65","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of these representations is a Morse Connection Graph (MCG), a directed graph whose nodes correspond to Morse sets, generalizing stationary points and periodic trajectories, and arcs - to trajectories connecting them. While being useful for simple vector fields, the MCG can be hard to comprehend for topologically rich vector fields, containing a large number of features. This paper describes a visual representation of the MCG, inspired by previous work on graph visualization. Our approach aims to preserve the spatial relationships between the MCG arcs and nodes and highlight the coherent behavior of connecting trajectories. Using simulations of ocean flow, we show that it can provide useful information on the flow structure. This paper focuses specifically on MCGs computed for piecewise constant (PC) vector fields. In particular, we describe extensions of the PC framework that make it more flexible and better suited for analysis of data on complex shaped domains with a boundary. We also describe a topology simplification scheme that makes our MCG visualizations less ambiguous. Despite the focus on the PC framework, our approach could also be applied to graph representations or topological skeletons computed using different methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634162","Trajectory;Computer graphics;Topology;Corporate acquisitions;Two dimensional displays;Morse connection graph;Vector field topology","Trajectory;Computer graphics;Topology;Corporate acquisitions;Two dimensional displays","data visualisation;graph theory;vectors","Morse connection graph visualization;multiscale graph representations;Morse sets;stationary points;periodic trajectories;topologically rich 2D vector fields;MCG visual representation;MCG arcs;MCG nodes;PC vector field;piecewise constant vector field;topological skeletons","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Theoretical","2","","34","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared to previous methods, our approach does not require the manual setting of a threshold in order to generate the training data or to extract the vortices.

In this paper, we propose a unified audio-driven approach to endow 3D talking faces with personalized pose dynamics. To achieve this goal, we establish an original person-specific dataset, providing corresponding head poses and face shapes for each video. Our framework is composed of two separate modules: PoseGAN and PGFace. Given an input audio, PoseGAN first produces a head pose sequence for the 3D head, and then, PGFace utilizes the audio and pose information to generate natural face models. With the combination of these two parts, a 3D talking head with dynamic head movement can be constructed. Experimental evidence indicates that our method can generate person-specific head pose sequences that are in sync with the input audio and that best match with the human experience of talking heads.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3117484","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072382); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2007661); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557828","Audio-driven generation;3D talking face;personalized pose;generative adversarial network","Faces;Three-dimensional displays;Head;Shape;Solid modeling;Hidden Markov models;Dynamics","","","","1","","","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Perhaps the only exception is in visualizing periodical time-dependent data, which is believed to be naturally supported by the radial layout. It has been demonstrated that the drawbacks of radial charts outweigh the benefits of this natural mapping. Visualization of daily patterns, as a special case, has not been systematically evaluated using radial charts. In contrast to yearly or weekly recurrent trends, the analysis of daily patterns on a radial chart may benefit from our trained skill on reading radial clocks that are ubiquitous in our culture. In a crowd-sourced experiment with 92 non-expert users, we evaluated the accuracy, efficiency, and subjective ratings of radial and linear charts for visualizing daily traffic accident patterns. We systematically compared juxtaposed 12-hours variants and single 24-hours variants for both layouts in four low-level tasks and one high-level interpretation task. Our results show that over all tasks, the most elementary 24-hours linear bar chart is most accurate and efficient and is also preferred by the users. This provides strong evidence for the use of linear layouts - even for visualizing periodical daily patterns.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934784","Austrian Science Fund(grant numbers:T 752-N30); PGI(grant numbers:24/K061); Universidad Nacional del Sur; VRVis(grant numbers:854174); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807238","Radial charts;time series series data;daily patterns;crowd-sourced experiment","Bars;Data visualization;Layout;Clocks;Task analysis;Time series analysis;Encoding","bar charts;crowdsourcing;data analysis;data visualisation;pattern recognition;road accidents;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","linear charts;radial chart;bar chart;daily traffic accident pattern visualization;daily pattern analysis","","1","","54","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For these layouts the simple list model is no longer valid, since the relations between the slots in which the results are placed do not form a sequence, that is, the relation among them is no longer that of a total order. In this paper we model these layouts as partial orders and show that a âstalwart displayâ property (a layout in which items' relevance is unambiguously conveyed by their display position) can be obtained only in the case of lists. For the other layouts, we define two classes of representation functions: âsafeâ functions (which display results without adding spurious structure) and ârichâ functions (which do not drop any structure from the result set), as well as an algorithm to optimally display fully ordered result sets in arbitrary display layouts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2870164","Ministerio de EducaciÃ³n de la NaciÃ³n(grant numbers:TIN2016-80630-P); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8464300","Display layout;prominence determination;attention fixation;computational complexity;display functions;query results display","Layout;Information retrieval;Data models;Standards;Computational modeling;Image retrieval","data visualisation;image retrieval;query processing","information retrieval system;complex displays;image retrieval;simple list model;total order;partial orders;stalwart display property;display position;arbitrary display layouts;rated items;nonlist display layouts","","1","","40","IEEE","13 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This color-coding scheme allows users to visually examine relationships between attributes, even between those that are displayed far apart, without repositioning or reordering axes. We adopt the Visual Information Seeking Mantra so that the polylines of the original PCP can be used to show details of a small number of selected items when the cluttering problem subsides.

To assist this process, we present ChartStory for crafting data stories from a collection of user-created charts, using a style akin to comic panels to imply the underlying sequence and logic of data-driven narratives. Our approach is to operationalize established design principles into an advanced pipeline which characterizes charts by their properties and similarity, and recommends ways to partition, layout, and caption story pieces to serve a narrative. ChartStory also augments this pipeline with intuitive user interactions for visual refinement of generated data comics. We extensively and holistically evaluate ChartStory via a trio of studies. We first assess how the tool supports data comic creation in comparison to a manual baseline tool. Data comics from this study are subsequently compared and evaluated to ChartStorys automated recommendations by a team of narrative visualization practitioners. This is followed by a pair of interview studies with data scientists using their own datasets and charts who provide an additional assessment of the system.

Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from the Gleicher et al.'s survey [19], we elaborate on relevant empirical evidence that we distilled from our survey (e.g., the actual effectiveness of the layouts in different study settings) and identify novel facets that the original work did not cover (e.g., the familiarity of the layouts to people).

However, understanding this provenance can be difficult. First, making sense of the reasoning in intermediate steps is time-consuming. Especially in distributed sensemaking, the provenance is less cohesive because each analyst only sees a small portion of the data without an understanding of the overall collaboration workflow. Second, analysis errors from one step can propagate to later steps. Furthermore, in exploratory sensemaking, it is difficult to define what an error is since there are no correct answers to reference. In this paper, we explore provenance analysis for distributed sense-making in the context of crowdsourcing, where distributed analysis contributions are captured in microtasks. We propose crowd auditing as a way to help individual analysts visualize and trace provenance to debug distributed sensemaking. To evaluate this concept, we implemented a crowd auditing tool, CrowdTrace. Our user study-based evaluation demonstrates that CrowdTrace offers an effective mechanism to audit and refine multi-step crowd sensemaking.","","978-1-7281-8014-4","10.1109/VIS47514.2020.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331303","Crowdsourcing;sensemaking;crowd auditing","Crowdsourcing;Conferences;Refining;Distributed databases;Collaboration;Tools;Cognition","data analysis;data visualisation;inference mechanisms","crowd auditing;reasoning;provenance analysis;exploratory sensemaking;sensemaking analysis;distributed sensemaking;provenance visualization;CrowdTrace","","1","","33","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We develop a method to compute it based on a classification network and a Markov Random Field (MRF). The classification network learns view-based distinction by handling multiple views of a 3D object. Using a classification network has an advantage of avoiding the training data problem which has become a major obstacle of applying deep learning to 3D object understanding tasks. The MRF estimates the parameters of a linear model for combining the view-based distinction maps. The experiments using several publicly accessible datasets show that the distinctive regions detected by our method are not just significantly different from those detected by methods based on handcrafted features, but more consistent with human perception. We also compare it with other perceptual measures and quantitatively evaluate its performance in the context of two applications. Furthermore, due to the view-based nature of our method, we are able to easily extend mesh distinction to 3D scenes containing multiple objects.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2885750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567954","3D mesh;distinction;neural network;Markov random field","Three-dimensional displays;Task analysis;Shape;Two dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Training;Markov random fields","feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;neural nets;object detection;object recognition","multiple objects;mesh distinction;view-based nature;distinctive regions;view-based distinction maps;3D object understanding tasks;Markov Random Field;classification network;3D surface mesh;human perception","","1","","65","IEEE","7 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In numerical experiments, Eiffel summarization results outperformed those of traditional clustering algorithms with respect to the influence-flow-based objective. Moreover, a flow map representation is proposed and adapted to the case of influence graph summarization, which supports two modes of evolutionary visualization (i.e., flip-book and movie) to expedite the analysis of influence graph dynamics. We conducted two controlled user experiments to evaluate our technique on influence graph summarization and visualization respectively. We also showcased the system in the evolutionary influence analysis of two typical scenarios, the citation influence of scientific papers and the social influence of emerging online events.

This allows for the most recent data to be displayed in detail, while older data is shown in an aggregated form according to how long ago it was received. However, the transitions applied between visualizations with different aggregations must not compromise the understandability of the data flow. Particularly, new data should be perceived considering the context established by older data, and the visualizations should not be perceived as independent or un-connected. In this paper, we present the first study on transitions between two contiguous visualizations, focusing on time series data. We developed several animated transitions between a scatter plot, where all data points are individually represented as they arrive, and other visualizations where data is displayed in an aggregated form.

They are often used in small multiple settings for a visual comparison of many data points. However, their overall visual appearance is strongly influenced by the ordering of dimensions. To this end, two orthogonal categories of layout strategies are proposed in the literature: order dimensions by similarity to get homogeneously shaped glyphs vs. order by dissimilarity to emphasize spikes and salient shapes. While there is evidence that salient shapes support clustering tasks, evaluation, and direct comparison of data-driven ordering strategies has not received much research attention. We contribute an empirical user study to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, and user confidence in visual clustering tasks using star glyphs.

With interaction snapshots, users can interact concurrently while the snapshots load.

To create an occupancy bitmap, we rasterize marks onto a bitmap based on the area they occupy in the chart.

This paper describes a fine grained parallel method for computing the Morse-Smale complex that is implemented on a GPU.

However, previous detection methods of the viscous and gravitational fingers are based on density thresholding, which provides limited geometric information of the fingers. The geometric structures of fingers and their evolution are important yet little studied in the literature. In this article, we explore the geometric detection and evolution of the fingers in detail to elucidate the dynamics of the instability. We propose a ridge voxel detection method to guide the extraction of finger cores from three-dimensional (3D) scalar fields. After skeletonizing finger cores into skeletons, we design a spanning tree based approach to capture how fingers branch spatially from the finger skeletons. Finally, we devise a novel geometric-glyph augmented tracking graph to study how the fingers and their branches grow, merge, and split over time.

Existing approaches mostly focus on the visual analysis of the final model performance after training and are often limited to aggregate performance measures. In this paper, we introduce InstanceFlow, a novel dual-view visualization tool that allows users to analyze the learning behavior of classifiers over time at the instance-level. A Sankey diagram visualizes the flow of instances throughout epochs, with on-demand detailed glyphs and traces for individual instances.

In this paper, we present a visual analysis method that interactively constructs a high-quality graph for better model performance. In particular, we propose an interactive graph construction method based on the large margin principle.

It allows domain scientists to interactively explore this important type of scientific images in embedded spaces that are defined on the model prediction output, the actual labels, and the discovered feature space of neural networks. Users are allowed to flexibly select instance images, their clusters, and compare them regarding the specified visual representation of attributes. The exploration is guided by the manifestation of model performance related to mutual relationships among attributes, which often affect the learning accuracy and effectiveness.

Yet, this pattern extraction does not occur in a single glance. Instead, research on visual attention suggests that the visual system iteratively applies a sequence of filtering operations on an image, extracting patterns from subsets of visual information over time, while selectively inhibiting other information at each of these moments. To demonstrate that this powerful series of filtering operations also occurs during the perception of visualized data, we designed a task where participants made judgments from one class of marks on a scatterplot, presumably incentivizing them to relatively ignore other classes of marks. Participants consistently missed a conspicuous dinosaur in the ignored collection of marks (93% for a 1s presentation, and 61% for 2.5s), but not in a control condition where the incentive to ignore that collection was removed (25% for a 1s presentation, and 11% for 2.5s), revealing that data visualizations are not âseenâ in a single glance, and instead require an active process of exploration.","","978-1-6654-3335-8","10.1109/VIS49827.2021.9623273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623273","perception & cognition;attention;communcation/presentation","Dinosaurs;Visualization;Filtration;Data visualization;Process control;Blindness;Visual systems","data visualisation;feature extraction;image processing;visual perception","data visualizations;jurassic mark;inattentional blindness;datasaurus;visual system;pattern extraction","","1","","37","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this gap, we start from the first principles and aim to answer the fundamental question: how can we describe the message of a scientific chart? We contribute a fact-evidence reasoning framework (FaEvR) by augmenting the conventional visualization pipeline with the stages of gathering and associating evidence for decoding the facts presented in a chart.

The use of zooming in scatterplots can help alleviate this problem. With multiple zoom levels, more screen real estate is available, allowing objects to be placed in a less crowded way. We call this type of visualization scalable scatterplot visualizations, or SSV for short. Despite the potential of SSVs, existing systems and toolkits fall short in supporting the authoring of SSVs due to three limitations. First, many systems have limited scalability, assuming that data fits in the memory of one computer. Second, too much developer work, e.g., using custom code to generate mark layouts or render objects, is required. Third, many systems focus on only a small subset of the SSV design space (e.g. supporting a specific type of visual marks). To address these limitations, we have developed Kyrix-S, a system for easy authoring of SSVs at scale. Kyrix-S derives a declarative grammar that enables specification of a variety of SSVs in a few tens of lines of code, based on an existing survey of scatterplot tasks and designs. The declarative grammar is supported by a distributed layout algorithm which automatically places visual marks onto zoom levels. We store data in a multi-node database and use multi-node spatial indexes to achieve interactive browsing of large SSVs. Extensive experiments show that 1) Kyrix-S enables interactive browsing of SSVs of billions of objects, with response times under 500ms and 2) Kyrix-S achieves 4X-9X reduction in specification compared to a state-of-the-art authoring system.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030372","NSF(grant numbers:OAC-1940175,OAC-1939945,IIS-1452977,DGE-1855886,IIS-1850115); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:FA8750-17-2-0107); Data Systems and AI Lab initiative(grant numbers:3882825); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222038","pan/zoom visualization;declarative grammar;scalability;performance optimization","Visualization;Data visualization;Layout;Grammar;Scalability;Semantics;Heating systems","authoring systems;Big Data;data visualisation;grammars;real-time systems;rendering (computer graphics)","Kyrix-S;authoring scalable scatterplot visualizations;static scatterplots;overdraw problem;big datasets;object overlap causes undesirable visual clutter;multiple zoom levels;screen real estate;visualization scalable scatterplot visualizations;developer work;custom code;mark layouts;render objects;systems focus;SSV design space;visual marks;easy authoring;declarative grammar;scatterplot tasks;state-of-the-art authoring system;SSV","","1","","54","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a novel neural rendering pipeline, which is trained end-to-end to generate a sparse adaptive sampling structure from a given low-resolution input image, and reconstructs a high-resolution image from the sparse set of samples. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate that the selection of structures that are relevant for the final visual representation can be jointly learned together with the reconstruction of this representation from these structures. Therefore, we introduce differentiable sampling and reconstruction stages, which can leverage back-propagation based on supervised losses solely on the final image. We shed light on the adaptive sampling patterns generated by the network pipeline and analyze its use for volume visualization including isosurface and direct volume rendering.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3039340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9264699","Volume visualization;adaptive sampling;deep learning","Image reconstruction;Data visualization;Pipelines;Image resolution;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics);Neural networks","","","","1","","","IEEE","19 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Numerous methods have been extended from static scenarios to model dynamic scenes. If the states or poses of the dynamic object repeat often during a sequence (but not necessarily periodically), we call such a repetitive motion. There are many objects, such as toys, machines, and humans, undergoing repetitive motions. Our key observation is that when a motion-state repeats, we can sample the scene under the same motion state again but using a different set of parameters; thus, providing more information of each motion state. This enables robustly acquiring dense 3D information difficult for objects with repetitive motions using only simple hardware. After the motion sequence, we group temporally disjoint observations of the same motion state together and produce a smooth space-time reconstruction of the scene. Effectively, the dynamic scene modeling problem is converted to a series of static scene reconstructions, which are easier to tackle. The varying sampling parameters can be, for example, structured-light patterns, illumination directions, and viewpoints resulting in different modeling techniques. Based on this observation, we present an image-based motion-state framework and demonstrate our paradigm using either a synchronized or an unsynchronized structured-light acquisition method.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332229","Three-dimensional graphics and realism;digitization and image capture;geometric modeling.","Layout;Image reconstruction;Robustness;Humans;Image converters;Cameras;Computer graphics;Hardware;Image sampling;Lighting","computer graphics;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;image sequences","repetitive motion modelling;dynamic 3D object model;computer graphics;motion sequence;space-time reconstruction;dynamic scene modeling problem;static scene reconstructions;structured-light patterns;image-based motion-state framework;unsynchronized structured-light acquisition method;synchronized structured-light acquisition method","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Lighting;Models, Theoretical;Motion","1","","41","","13 Nov 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We consider two versions of the problem: fixed projections and variable projections. MPSE with fixed projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices defined on the data points, along with the same number of projections and embeds the points in 3D so that the pairwise distances are preserved in the given projections. MPSE with variable projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices and embeds the points in 3D while also computing the appropriate projections that preserve the pairwise distances. The proposed approach can be useful in multiple scenarios: from creating simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs on the same set of vertices, to reconstructing a 3D object from multiple 2D snapshots, to analyzing data from multiple points of view. We provide a functional prototype of MPSE that is based on an adaptive and stochastic generalization of multi-dimensional scaling to multiple distances and multiple variable projections.

Visualizing temporal data is inherently difficult, due to the many aspects that need to be communicated to the users (e.g., time and variable changes). This is an important topic in visualization, and a wide range of visualization techniques dealing with different tasks have already been designed. In this paper we propose popup-plots, a novel concept where the common interaction of 3D rotation is used to navigate through the data. This allows the users to view the data from different perspectives without having to learn and adapt to new interaction concepts. Popup-plots are therefore a novel method for visualizing and interacting with dependent variables over time. We extend 2D plots with the temporal information by bending the space according to the time. The bending is calculated based on a spherical coordinates approach, which is continuously influenced by the viewing direction towards the plot. Hence, the plot can be viewed from various angles with seamless transitions in between, offering the possibility to analyze different aspects of the represented data. As the current viewing direction is inherently depicted by the shape of the data, the users are able to deduce which part of the data is currently viewed. The temporal information is encoded into the visualization itself, resembling annual rings of a tree. We demonstrate our method by applying it to data from two different domains, comprising measurements at spatial positions over time, and we also evaluated the usability of our solution.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2841385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368315","Temporal data;time-dependent visualization;3D plots;ellipsoidal coordinate system","Data visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Temperature measurement;Time measurement;Layout","data visualisation","popup-plots;temporal data visualization;dependent variables;interaction concepts;3D rotation;spherical coordinates","","1","","55","IEEE","29 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With PyramidTags, we introduce a novel approach for summarizing large text collections visually. In contrast to previous work, PyramidTags in particular aims at creating an improved representation that incorporates both temporal evolution and semantic relationship of visualized tags within the summarized document collection. As a result, it equips analysts with a visual starting point for interactive exploration to not only get an overview of the main terms and phrases of the corpus, but also to grasp important ideas and stories. Analysts can hover and select multiple tags to explore relationships and retrieve the most relevant documents. In this work, we apply PyramidTags to hundreds of thousands of web-crawled news reports.

Consequently, applications must either reduce rendering and simulation complexity - along with the richness of the experience - or offload complexity to a server. Within the context of edge-computing, a popular way to do this is through render streaming. Render streaming has been demonstrated for desktops and consoles. It has also been explored for HMDs. However, the latency requirements of head tracking make this application much more challenging. While mobile GPUs are not yet as capable as their desktop counterparts, we note that they are becoming more powerful and efficient. With the hard requirements of VR, it is worth continuing to investigate what schemes could optimally balance load, latency and quality. We propose an alternative we call edge-physics: streaming at the scene-graph level from a simulation running on edge-resources, analogous to cluster rendering. Scene streaming is not only straightforward, but compute and bandwidth efficient. The most demanding loops run locally. Jobs that hit the power-wall of mobile CPUs are off-loaded, while improving GPUs are leveraged, maximising compute utilisation. In this paper we create a prototypical implementation and evaluate its potential in terms of fidelity, bandwidth and performance. We show that an effective system which maintains high consistencies on typical edge-links can be easily built, but that some traditional concepts are not applicable, and a better understanding of the perception of motion is required to evaluate such a system comprehensively.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3067757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382921","virtual reality;streaming;edge-computing","Streaming media;Physics;Bandwidth;Quality of service;Servers;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics)","graph theory;graphics processing units;mobile computing;power aware computing;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","edge physics simulations;VR;mobile HMDs;power requirements;offload complexity;edge-computing;render streaming;latency requirements;head tracking;mobile GPUs;desktop counterparts;hard requirements;scene-graph level;edge-resources;cluster rendering;scene streaming;power-wall;mobile CPUs;typical edge-links;quality of service impact;simulation complexity;motion perception","","1","","55","IEEE","22 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Scalable Mesh Refinement for Canonical Polygonal Schemas of Extremely High Genus Shapes","M. Livesu","CNR IMATI, Genova, Liguria, Italy","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","24 Nov 2020","2021","27","1","254","260","Any closed manifold of genus g can be cut open to form a topological disk and then mapped to a regular polygon with 4g sides. This construction is called the canonical polygonal schema of the manifold, and is a key ingredient for many applications in graphics and engineering, where a parameterization between two shapes with same topology is often needed. The sides of the 4g-gon define on the manifold a system of loops, which all intersect at a single point and are disjoint elsewhere. Computing a shortest system of loops of this kind is NP-hard. A computationally tractable alternative consists of computing a set of shortest loops that are not fully disjoint in polynomial time using the greedy homotopy basis algorithm proposed by Erickson and Whittlesey and then detach them in post processing via mesh refinement. Despite this operation is conceptually simple, known refinement strategies do not scale well for high genus shapes, triggering a mesh growth that may exceed the amount of memory available in modern computers, leading to failures. In this article we study various local refinement operators to detach cycles in a system of loops, and show that there are important differences between them, both in terms of mesh complexity and preservation of the original surface. We ultimately propose two novel refinement approaches: the former greatly reduces the number of new elements in the mesh, possibly at the cost of a deviation from the input geometry. The latter allows to trade mesh complexity for geometric accuracy, bounding deviation from the input surface. Both strategies are trivial to implement, and experiments confirm that they allow to realize canonical polygonal schemas even for extremely high genus shapes where previous methods fail.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3010736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145719","Topology;polygonal schema;cut graph;homology;homotopy","Manifolds;Shape;Basis algorithms;Geometry;Complexity theory;Topology;Robustness","computational complexity;computational geometry;geometry;mesh generation;polynomials;solid modelling","greedy homotopy basis algorithm;mesh growth;local refinement operators;mesh complexity;canonical polygonal schema;scalable mesh refinement;polygonal schemas;topological disk;genus shapes","","1","","24","IEEE","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Interpreting these modifiers is often difficult for these tools because their meanings lack clear semantics and are in part defined by context and personal user preferences. This paper presents a system called Sentifiers that makes a first step in better understanding these vague predicates. The algorithm employs word co-occurrence and sentiment analysis to determine which data attributes and filters ranges to associate with the vague predicates. The provenance results from the algorithm are exposed to the user as interactive text that can be repaired and refined.

Over two experiments, we evaluate people's sense of surface contact given both traditional and non-traditional shadow shading methods in optical see-through augmented reality (OST AR), video see-through augmented reality (VST AR), and virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays. Our results provide evidence that nontraditional shading techniques for rendering shadows in AR displays may enhance the accuracy of one's perception of surface contact. This finding implies a possible tradeoff between photorealism and accuracy of depth perception, especially in OST AR displays.

As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes.

First, to address the problem of scarcity of training sketch data, we present a sketch augmentation method that more closely mimics human sketches compared to simple image transformation. Our method generates more sketches from the existing training data by (i) removing a stroke, (ii) adjusting a stroke, and (iii) rotating the sketch. As such, we generate a large number of sketch samples for training our neural network. Second, we obtain the 2D renderings of each 3D model in the shape database by determining the view positions that best depict the 3D shape: i.e., avoiding self-occlusion, showing the most salient features, and following how a human would normally sketch the model. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the best viewing positions of each 3D model and generates their 2D images for the next step. Third, our method uses a cross-domain learning strategy based on two Siamese CNNs that pair up sketches and the 2D shape images. A joint Bayesian measure is used to measure the output similarity from these CNNs to maximize inter-class similarity and minimize intra-class similarity.

Further, the output of these queries require complex annotations and overlays which need to be displayed and dismissed on demand to avoid clutter. In this work we introduce SmartCues, a library to support details-on-demand through dynamically computed overlays. For end-users, SmartCues provides multitouch interactions to construct complex queries for a variety of details. For designers, SmartCues offers an interaction library that can be used out-of-the-box, and can be extended for new charts and detail types.

STAD generates an abstract representation of high-dimensional data by giving each data point a location in a graph which preserves the approximate distances in the original high-dimensional space. The STAD graph is built upon the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to which new edges are added until the correlation between the distances from the graph and the original dataset is maximized. Additionally, STAD supports the inclusion of additional functions to focus the exploration and allow the analysis of data from new perspectives, emphasizing traits in data which otherwise would remain hidden.

Techniques such as animated or juxtaposed tree visualizations are not capable of providing a good overview of the time series and lack expressiveness in conveying changes over time. Nested streamgraphs provide a better understanding of the data evolution, but lack the clear outline of hierarchical structures at a given timestep. Furthermore, these approaches are often limited to static hierarchies or exclude complex hierarchical changes in the data, limiting their use cases. We propose a novel visual metaphor capable of providing a static overview of all hierarchical changes over time, as well as clearly outlining the hierarchical structure at each individual time step. Our method allows for smooth transitions between treemaps and nested streamgraphs, enabling the exploration of the trade-off between dynamic behavior and hierarchical structure.

These systems can support graphics-driven practices by bridging lazy data-binding mechanisms with vector-graphics editing tools. Yet, despite their expressive power, visualization authoring systems often assume that users want to generate visual representations that they already have in mind rather than explore designs. They also impose a data-to-graphics workflow, where binding data dimensions to graphical properties is a necessary step for generating visualization layouts. In this paper, we introduce StructGraphics, an approach for creating data-agnostic and fully reusable visualization designs. StructGraphics enables designers to construct visualization designs by drawing graphics on a canvas and then structuring their visual properties without relying on a concrete dataset or data schema. In StructGraphics, tabular data structures are derived directly from the structure of the graphics. Later, designers can link these structures with real datasets through a spreadsheet user interface. StructGraphics supports the design and reuse of complex data visualizations by combining graphical property sharing, by-example design specification, and persistent layout constraints. We demonstrate the power of the approach through a gallery of visualization examples and reflect on its strengths and limitations in interaction with graphic designers and data visualization experts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222091","Visualization design;graphical structures;visualization grammars;layout constraints;infographics;flexible data binding","Data visualization;Layout;Visualization;Tools;Programming;Task analysis","authoring systems;computer graphics;data structures;data visualisation;interactive systems;spreadsheet programs;user interfaces","fully reusable visualization designs;StructGraphics;visual properties;concrete dataset;tabular data structures;spreadsheet user interface;complex data visualizations;graphical property sharing;by-example design specification;visualization examples;graphic designers;data visualization experts;flexible visualization design;reusable graphical structures;information visualization research;powerful systems;author custom data visualizations;textual programming;graphics-driven practices;lazy data-binding mechanisms;vector-graphics editing tools;expressive power;visualization authoring systems;visual representations;explore designs;data-to-graphics workflow;binding data dimensions;visualization layouts;data-agnostic structures","","1","","59","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The tactic in badminton is defined as a sequence of consecutive strokes. Most existing methods use statistical models to find sequential patterns of strokes and apply 2D visualizations such as glyphs and statistical charts to explore and analyze the discovered patterns. However, in badminton, spatial information like the shuttle trajectory, which is inherently 3D, is the core of a tactic. The lack of sufficient spatial awareness in 2D visualizations largely limited the tactic analysis of badminton. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to study the tactic analysis of badminton in a 3D environment and propose an immersive visual analytics system, TIVEE, to assist users in exploring and explaining badminton tactics from multi-levels. Users can first explore various tactics from the third-person perspective using an unfolded visual presentation of stroke sequences. By selecting a tactic of interest, users can turn to the first-person perspective to perceive the detailed kinematic characteristics and explain its effects on the game result.

Although it is straightforward to provide interfaces for visualization that represent multiple states of the network (i.e., multiple timeslices) either simultaneously (e.g., through small multiples) or interactively (e.g., through interactive animation), these interfaces might not support tasks in which disjoint timeslices need to be compared. Since these tasks are key for understanding the dynamic aspects of the network, understanding which interactive visualizations best support these tasks is important. We present the results of a series of laboratory experiments comparing two traditional approaches (small multiples and interactive animation), with a more recent approach based on interactive timeslicing. The tasks were performed on a large display through a touch interface. Participants completed 24 trials of three tasks with all techniques.

This data structure allows us to compress, render, and query segmentation histograms. Such histograms arise when building a mipmap of a volume containing segmentation IDs. Each voxel in the histogram mipmap contains a convex combination (mixture) of segmentation IDs. Each mixture represents the distribution of IDs in the respective voxel's children. Our method factorizes these mixtures into a series of linear interpolations between exactly two segmentation IDs. The result is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are topologically ordered. Pruning replicate nodes in the tree followed by compression allows us to store the resulting data structure efficiently. During rendering, transfer functions are propagated from sources (leafs) through the DAG to allow for efficient, pre-filtered rendering at interactive frame rates. Assembly of histogram contributions across the footprint of a given volume allows us to efficiently query partial histograms, achieving up to 178 x speed-up over naive parallelized range queries. Additionally, we apply the Mixture Graph to compute correctly pre-filtered volume lighting and to interactively explore segments based on shape, geometry, and orientation using multi-dimensional transfer functions.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030451","College of Science and Engineering (CSE); Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9224646","Segmented Volumes;Data Structures;Sparse Data","Rendering (computer graphics);Histograms;Data structures;Semantics;Encoding;Transfer functions;Interpolation","data structures;directed graphs;image segmentation;interpolation;query processing;rendering (computer graphics);transfer functions;trees (mathematics)","mixture graph;segmentation IDs;histogram mipmap;respective voxel;directed acyclic graph;data structure;histogram contributions;partial histograms;naive parallelized range queries;segmentation histogram compression;querying segmentation rendering;segmentation histogram querying;multidimensional transfer functions;linear interpolations","","1","","56","IEEE","15 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With very few exceptions, projection techniques are designed to map data from a high-dimensional space to a visual space so as to preserve some dissimilarity (similarity) measure, such as the Euclidean distance for example. In fact, although adopting distinct mathematical formulations designed to favor different aspects of the data, most multidimensional projection methods strive to preserve dissimilarity measures that encapsulate geometric properties such as distances or the proximity relation between data objects. However, geometric relations are not the only interesting property to be preserved in a projection. For instance, the analysis of particular structures such as clusters and outliers could be more reliably performed if the mapping process gives some guarantee as to topological invariants such as connected components and loops. This paper introduces TopoMap, a novel projection technique which provides topological guarantees during the mapping process. In particular, the proposed method performs the mapping from a high-dimensional space to a visual space, while preserving the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the high-dimensional data, ensuring that the filtrations generate the same connected components when applied to the original as well as projected data. The presented case studies show that the topological guarantee provided by TopoMap not only brings confidence to the visual analytic process but also can be used to assist in the assessment of other projection methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030441","DARPA D3M program; Moore Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU; NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1229185,CCF-1533564,CNS-1544753,CNS-1730396,CNS-1828576); European Commission(grant numbers:ERC-2019-COG); âTORIâ(grant numbers:863464); CNPq-Brazil(grant numbers:303552/2017-4,304301/2019-1); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) - Brazil(grant numbers:2013/07375-0,2016/04190-7,2018/07551-6,2018/24293-0); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222271","Topological data analysis;computational topology;high-dimensional data;projection","Three-dimensional displays;Data visualization;Two dimensional displays;Data analysis;Layout;Visualization;Topology","computational geometry;data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;solid modelling;topology","visual analytic process;projected data;0-dimensional persistence diagram;topological guarantee;novel projection technique;mapping process;data objects;encapsulate geometric properties;multidimensional projection methods;dissimilarity measure;visual space;high-dimensional space;map data;projection techniques;visualization;high-dimensional data analytics;0-dimensional homology preserving projection;TopoMap","","1","","79","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then simulate the occlusion patterns in head-mounted camera views on the captured ground truth using a ray casting algorithm and learn a deep neural network to infer the occluded body parts.

In this paper, we propose the novel concept of the faceted High-Order Correlation Graph (HOCG). Compared with previous, low-order correlation graphs, HOCG achieves better user interactivity, computational scalability, and domain generality through synthesizing heterogeneous types of objects, their anomalies, and the multimodal relationships, all in a single graph. We design elaborate visual metaphors, interaction models, and the coordinated multiple view based interface to allow users to fully unleash the visual analytics power of the HOCG.

Existing studies related to student engagement and time management in online learning mainly focus on providing self-regulated learning strategies and evaluating learning performance.

Recurrent neural network (RNN) based DRL has demonstrated superior performance, as RNNs can effectively capture the temporal evolution of the environment and respond with proper agent actions. However, apart from the outstanding performance, little is known about how RNNs understand the environment internally and what has been memorized over time. Revealing these details is extremely important for deep learning experts to understand and improve DRLs, which in contrast, is also challenging due to the complicated data transformations inside these models. In this paper, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning Interactive Visual Explorer (DRLIVE), a visual analytics system to effectively explore, interpret, and diagnose RNN-based DRLs. Focused on DRL agents trained for different Atari games, DRLIVE targets to accomplish three tasks: game episode exploration, RNN hidden/cell state examination, and interactive model perturbation. Using the system, one can flexibly explore a DRL agent through interactive visualizations, discover interpretable RNN cells by prioritizing RNN hidden/cell states with a set of metrics, and further diagnose the DRL model by interactively perturbing its inputs. Through concrete studies with multiple deep learning experts, we validated the efficacy of DRLIVE.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3076749","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420254","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL);recurrent neural network (RNN);model interpretation;visual analytics","Games;Visual analytics;Analytical models;Reinforcement learning;Recurrent neural networks;Perturbation methods;Data models","","","","1","","","IEEE","30 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

More specifically, it is often valuable to understand which ranges of which input variables lead to particular values of a given target variable. Unfortunately, with an increasing number of independent variables, this process may become cumbersome and time-consuming due to the many possible combinations that have to be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visualize correlations between input variables and a target output variable that scales to hundreds of variables. We developed a visual model based on neural networks that can be explored in a guided way to help analysts find and understand such correlations. First, we train a neural network to predict the target from the input variables. Then, we visualize the inner workings of the resulting model to help understand relations within the data set. We further introduce a new regularization term for the backpropagation algorithm that encourages the neural network to learn representations that are easier to interpret visually.

They become increasingly important in modern material, earth, and life sciences. The stress-strain response of such materials can be characterized (to first-order) by the three-dimensional fourth-order stiffness tensor. There are different anisotropy classes, i.e. material symmetries, that differ in the number and orientation of symmetry planes characteristic of the material. A three-dimensional fourth-order stiffness tensor of a hyperelastic material has up to 21 independent coefficients representing both moduli and orientation information which challenges any visualization method. Therefore, we use a fourth-order tensor decomposition to compute the anisotropy classes and the position of the corresponding symmetry planes. To facilitate judgment of the significance of the amount of anisotropy, we construct an isotropic material. Based on these computations, we design a glyph that represents the stiffness tensor. We demonstrate our method in a finite deformation setting of an initially isotropic hyperelastic material of Ogden class which is often modeling biological tissue. Upon deformation, the stiffness tensor can evolve along with its symmetry creating an inhomogeneous, unsteady fourth-order tensor field in three dimensions.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933592","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933592","Stiffness Tensor;Deviatoric Decomposition;Hyper-elastic Material;Tensor Field Visualization","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Mirrors;Visualization;Strain;Young's modulus;Image color analysis","biological tissues;decomposition;deformation;elastic moduli;elasticity;stress-strain relations;tensors","fourth-order tensor decomposition;isotropic hyperelastic material;biological tissue;stress-strain response;three-dimensional fourth-order stiffness tensor;elastic moduli;deformation","","1","","17","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network model that generates high-quality 3D caricature directly from a simple normal face photo.

To address this challenge, we (1) build a large dataset of 6,100 3D caricature meshes and use it to establish a PCA model in the 3D caricature shape space, (2) reconstruct a 3D normal full head from the input face photo and use its PCA representation in the 3D caricature shape space to set up correspondence between the input photo and 3D caricature shape, and (3) propose a novel character loss and a novel caricature loss based on previous psychological studies on caricatures.

However, this trial-and-error approach is laborious and disorganized, which is especially challenging for novices. This paper presents a technique that enables users to effortlessly find a matrix reordering they want. Specifically, we design a generative model that learns a latent space of diverse matrix reorderings of the given graph.

In many applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however, computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage, while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114872","National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:1664848,1664858); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552880","Topological data analysis;Persistence diagrams;Persistence diagram distances;Learned hashing;Clustering","Binary codes;Training;Propagation losses;Histograms;Generative adversarial networks;Hash functions;Water resources","binary codes;data visualisation;file organisation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern clustering;topology","filtered topological spaces;computational cost;binary code representation;diagram distance loss function;standard representations;Hamming distance;diagram clustering;domain-oblivious approach;data visualization;persistence diagram hashing;generative adversarial network;GAN;learning;topological similarity properties;datasets;vectorized representations;memory usage","","","","84","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this process, data augmentation is employed to improve the generalization of our approach to handle a variety of guzheng music inputs. Through extensive objective and subjective experiments, we show that our method can generate visually plausible guzheng-playing animations that are well synchronized with the input guzheng music, and it can significantly outperform \uline{the state-of-the-art} methods. In addition, through an ablation study, we validate the contributions of the carefully-designed modules in our framework.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3115902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9551755","deep learning;generative adversarial networks;motion capture;guzheng animation;music-driven;data augmentation","Animation;Generative adversarial networks;Instruments;Motion segmentation;Hidden Markov models;Facial animation;Deep learning","","","","","","","IEEE","28 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

When there are more than just a few labels, the efficiency of the interface decreases as the user has to search for a given label sequentially. The search can be accelerated by sorting the labels alphabetically, but sorting all labels results in long and intersecting leader lines from the anchor points to the labels. This paper proposes a partially-sorted concentric label layout that leverages the search efficiency of sorting while avoiding the label display problems of long or intersecting leader lines. The labels are partitioned into a small number of sorted sequences displayed on circles of increasing radii. Since the labels on a circle are sorted, the user can quickly search each circle. A tight upper bound derived from circular permutation theory limits the number of circles and thereby the complexity of the label layout. For example, 12 labels require at most three circles. When the application allows it, the labels are presorted to further reduce the number of circles in the layout. The layout was tested in a user study where it significantly reduced the label searching time compared to a conventional single-circle layout.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3106492","National Natural Science Foundation of China through Projects(grant numbers:61932003,61772051); National Key RD plan(grant numbers:2019YFC1521102); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L182016); Beijing Program for International ST Cooperation Project(grant numbers:Z191100001619003); Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data(Shenzhen)(grant numbers:518000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9523830","Augmented Reality;Label layout;Fast label finding","Layout;Sorting;Annotations;Search problems;Labeling;Gaze tracking;Augmented reality","augmented reality;computational complexity;data visualisation;sorting;text analysis","efficient label localization;Augmented Reality labeling;label text;given label;labels results;partially-sorted concentric label layout;label display problems;circle;partially-sorted concentric layout","","","","49","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We take a step toward establishing guidelines for designing such overlays by studying the relationship between three different patterns (filled, striped and dotted patterns), two pattern densities, the presence or not of a solid outline, two types of background (blank and with trees), and the opacity of the overlay. For each combination of factors, participants set the faintest and the strongest acceptable opacity values.

In real systems, such as those found in ecology, the relationships between time series variables are generally not static; instead, these relationships are dynamical and change in a nonlinear or state-dependent manner. To further understand such systems, we investigate integrating methods that appropriately characterize these dynamics (i.e., methods that measure interactions as they change with time-varying system states) with visualization techniques that can help analyze the behavior of the system. Here, we focus on empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a state-of-the-art method that specifically identifies causal variables and measures changing state-dependent relationships between time series variables. Instead of using approaches centered on parametric equations, EDM is an equation-free approach that studies systems based on their dynamic attractors. We propose a visual analytics system to support the identification and mechanistic interpretation of system states using an EDM-constructed dynamic graph. This work, as detailed in four analysis tasks and demonstrated with a GUI, provides a novel synthesis of EDM and visualization techniques such as brush-link visualization and visual summarization to interpret dynamic graphs representing ecosystem dynamics. We applied our proposed system to ecological simulation data and real data from a marine mesocosm study as two key use cases. Our case studies show that our visual analytics tools support the identification and interpretation of the system state by the user, and enable us to discover both confirmatory and new findings in ecosystem dynamics. Overall, we demonstrated that our system can facilitate an understanding of how systems function beyond the intuitive analysis of high-dimensional information based on specific domain knowledge.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028956","Keihanshin Consortium for Fostering the Next Generation of Global Leaders in Research (K-CONNEX); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:19K20278); JST CREST(grant numbers:JP-MJCR1511); Lenfest Ocean Program award(grant numbers:00028335); Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program(grant numbers:15 RC-2509); EPA-STAR Fellowship Program; National Science Foundation ABI-Innovation(grant numbers:DBI-1667584); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DEB-1020372); U.S. Department of the Interior(grant numbers:NPS-P20AC00527); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216532","Visual analytics;empirical dynamic modeling;dynamic network;exploratory data analysis","Visual analytics;Time series analysis;Data visualization;Ecosystems;Task analysis;Time measurement;Ecology","biology computing;data analysis;data visualisation;ecology;graph theory;graphical user interfaces","GUI;time-varying system states;state-dependent manner;time series variables;mechanistic insights;observational time series data;empirical dynamic modeling;visual analytics approach;visual analytics tools;ecological simulation data;ecosystem dynamics;dynamic graphs;visual summarization;brush-link visualization;visualization techniques;EDM-constructed dynamic graph;visual analytics system;equation-free approach","","","","58","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a novel light estimation method to predict 360Â° HDR environment maps from a single photograph with a limited field-of-view (FOV). We introduce the Dynamic Lighting network (DLNet), a convolutional neural network that dynamically generates the convolution filters based on the input photograph sample to adaptively learn the lighting cues within each photograph. We propose novel Spherical Multi-Scale Dynamic (SMD) convolutional modules to dynamically generate sample-specific kernels for decoding features in the spherical domain to predict 360Â° environment maps. Using DLNet and data augmentations with respect to FOV, an exposure multiplier, and color temperature, our model shows the capability of estimating lighting under diverse input variations. Compared with prior work that fixes the network filters once trained, our method maintains lighting consistency across different exposure multipliers and color temperature, and maintains robust light estimation accuracy as FOV increases. The surrounding lighting information estimated by our method ensures coherent illumination of 3D objects blended with the input photograph, enabling high fidelity augmented and mixed reality supporting a wide range of environmental lighting conditions and device sensors.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3106497","MBIE; TEC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9523888","Augmented reality;mixed reality;lighting;light estimation;deep learning","Lighting;Feature extraction;Estimation;Convolution;Image color analysis;Decoding;Adaptation models","augmented reality;convolutional neural nets;estimation theory;filtering theory;image colour analysis;lighting;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","data augmentations;FOV;color temperature;diverse input variations;network filters;lighting consistency;mixed reality;environmental lighting conditions;device sensors;adaptive light estimation;dynamic filtering;diverse lighting conditions;high dynamic range panoramic environment maps;mixed-reality;HDR environment map;consumer-level devices;light estimation method;single photograph;DLNet;convolutional neural network;input photograph sample;sample-specific kernels;illuminate virtual objects;AR-MR;augmented reality;spherical multiscale dynamic convolutional modules;SMD;limited field-of-view;dynamic lighting network","","","","44","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most reset strategies are based on simple heuristics by choosing a seemingly suitable solution, which may not perform well in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based reset algorithm adaptive to different RDW algorithms. Inspired by the approach of finite element analysis, our algorithm splits the boundary of the physical world by a set of endpoints. Each endpoint is assigned a reset vector to represent the optimized reset direction when hitting the boundary.

This paper presents (1) a narrative summarization algorithm to reduce the size and complexity of cyber security narratives with a user-customizable summarization level, and (2) a narrative visualization tailored for incident reports and network logs. An evaluation on real incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false positives and improves average precision by 41% while reducing average incident report size up to 79%. Together, the visualization and summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst.

At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed).

To overcome these limitations, we propose to employ powerful deep learning techniques to detect mesh Schelling points in an automatic manner, free from participant observation studies. Specifically, we utilize the mesh convolution and pooling operations to extract informative features from mesh objects, and then predict the 3D heat map of Schelling points in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we propose a Deep Schelling Network (DS-Net) to automatically detect the Schelling points, including a multi-scale fusion component and a novel region-specific loss function to improve our network for a better regression of heat maps. To the best of our knowledge, DS-Net is the first deep neural network for detecting Schelling points from 3D meshes. We evaluate DS-Net on a mesh Schelling point dataset obtained from participant observation studies. The experimental results demonstrate that DS-Net is capable of detecting mesh Schelling points effectively and outperforms various state-of-the-art mesh saliency methods and deep learning models, both qualitatively and quantitatively.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3144143","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684948","Deep Neural Network;Mesh Schelling Points;Geometric Deep Learning;Heat Map Regression","Three-dimensional displays;Deep learning;Heating systems;Feature extraction;Shape;Point cloud compression;Image edge detection","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As the data changes, the y-axis may need to be rescaled as the domain of the data changes. Each axis rescaling potentially improves the readability of the current chart, but may also disorient the user. In contrast to static visualizations, where there is considerable literature to help choose the appropriate y-axis scale, there is a lack of guidance about how and when rescaling should be used in dynamic visualizations. Existing visualization systems and libraries adapt a fixed global y-axis, or rescale every time the data changes. Yet, professional visualizations, such as in data journalism, do not adopt either strategy. They instead carefully and manually choose when to rescale based on the analysis task and data. To this end, we conduct a series of Mechanical Turk experiments to study the potential of dynamic axis rescaling and the factors that affect its effectiveness.

Since the overall structure of a BSP tree is encoded in a BSPI, traversing a BSPI is comparable to traversing the corresponding BSP tree. BSPI performs visibility sorting efficiently and accurately in the 2D image space by warping the reference image triangle-by-triangle instead of pixel-by-pixel. Multiple BSPIs can be combined to solve ""disocclusion,"" when an occluded portion of the scene becomes visible at a novel viewpoint.

Today, a number of tracking systems are available, ready to be used in industrial applications. However, such systems are hard to handle for a service maintenance engineer, due to obscure configuration procedures. In this paper, we investigate options towards replacing the manual configuration process with a machine learning approach based on automatically synthesized data. We present an automated process of creating object tracker facilities exclusively from synthetic data. The data is highly enhanced to train a convolutional neural network, while still being able to receive reliable and robust results during real world applications only from simple RGB cameras. Comparison against related work using the LINEMOD dataset showed that we are able to outperform similar approaches. For our intended industrial applications with high accuracy demands, its performance is still lower than common object tracking methods with manual configuration. Yet, it can greatly support those as an add-on during initialization, due to its higher reliability.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3089096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454303","object tracking;deep learning;industry 40;neural network;synthetic data;augmented reality;computer vision","Cameras;Target tracking;Optical imaging;Training;Neural networks;Tuning;Task analysis","","","","","","","CCBY","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics pipeline.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030443","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1452977,OAC-1940175,OAC-1939945,DGE-1855886,1841349); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:FA8750-17-2-0107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222249","Visual Analytics;Information Foraging;Data Augmentation","Task analysis;Visual analytics;Machine learning;Data models;Data visualization;Google;Training","data analysis;data visualisation;query processing","data foraging;complex data combinations;external data;human knowledge;data exploration;data curation;data analysis tasks;foraging loop;data construction;data attributes;analytics process;knowledge graph;exploratory columnar data augmentation;visual analytics system;CAVA","","","","76","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Installation and managing new versions has been challenging and time-consuming, historically. CPAW is an alternative that ensures installation and future updates are not a hassle to the user. CPAW ports the core iteration loop of CPA to a pure server-less browser environment using modern web-development technologies, allowing computationally heavy activities, like machine learning, to occur without freezing the user interface (UI). With a setup as simple as navigating to a website, CPAW presents a clean UI to the user to refine their classifier and explore pheno-typic data easily. We evaluated both the old and the new version of the software in an extensive domain expert study. We found that users could complete the essential classification tasks in CPAW and CPA 3.0 with the same efficiency. Additionally, users completed the tasks 20 percent faster using CPAW compared to CPA 3.0.

We propose a Dynamic Hierarchical Cognitive Graph (DHCG) representation to encode the environment structure by incorporating two critical spatial memory biases during exploration: categorical adjustment and \sequence order effect. We then extend the â`Fine-To-Coarseâ' (FTC), the most prevalent path-planning heuristic, to incorporate spatial uncertainty during recall through the DHCG. We conducted a lab-based Virtual Reality (VR) experiment to validate the proposed cognitive path-planning model and made three observations: (1) a statistically significant impact of sequence order effect on participants' route-choices, (2) approximately three hierarchical levels in the DHCG according to participants' recall data, and (3) similar trajectories and significantly similar wayfinding performances between participants and simulated cognitive agents on identical path-planning tasks. Furthermore, we performed two detailed simulation experiments with different FTC variants on a Manhattan-style grid. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed cognitive path-planning model successfully produces human-like paths and can capture human wayfinding's complex and dynamic nature, which traditional AI-based path-planning algorithms cannot capture.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3163794","NSF Awards(grant numbers:IIS-1703883,IIS-1955365,IIS-1955404); Singapore-ETH Centre(grant numbers:FI 370074016); Leonhard Obermeyer Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745822","Cognitive Path-Planning;Human Wayfinding;Fine-To-Course;Spatial Memory;Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering","Solid modeling;Computational modeling;Navigation;Distortion;Games;Data models;Task analysis","","","","","","","CCBY","31 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time-varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long-time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in-depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time-varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi-dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real-world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114875","NSFC(grant numbers:62072400); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:LR18F020001); Collaborative Innovation Center of Artificial Intelligence by MOE and Zhejiang Provincial Government (ZJU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557222","Visual causal analysis;urban time series;causal graph analysis","Time series analysis;Visual analytics;Compass;Air pollution;Correlation;Urban planning;Indexes","air pollution;causality;data analysis;data visualisation;environmental science computing;graph theory;time series;traffic information systems","causal analyses;compass;real-world urban datasets;causal analysis;urban time series;spatial time series;urban phenomena;time series partitioning;long-time observations;dynamic urban causality;dynamic causality;interpreting dynamic causal relations;multiple causal graphs;causal detection framework;Granger causality test;dynamic causal graph visualization;time-varying causal relations;spurious causal relations;suspicious causal relations","","","","89","IEEE","1 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moderation tasks are often laborious, complex, and even if semi-automated, they involve high-consequence human decisions that affect the safety and popular perception of the platforms. In this paper, through an interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers from social science, human-computer interaction, and visualization, we present a systematic understanding of how visual analytics can help in human-in-the-loop content moderation. We contribute a characterization of the data-driven problems and needs for proactive moderation and present a mapping between the needs and visual analytic tasks through a task abstraction framework.

In computer graphics, special attention has been given to the registration between two partial point clouds generated by scanning devices. State-of-the-art registration techniques still struggle when the overlap region between the two point clouds is small, and completely fail if there is no overlap between the scan pairs. In this paper, we present a learning-based technique that alleviates this problem, and allows registration between point clouds, presented in arbitrary poses, and having little or even no overlap, a setting that has been referred to as tele-registration. Our technique is based on a novel neural network design that learns a prior of a class of shapes and can complete a partial shape. The key idea is combining the registration and completion tasks in a way that reinforces each other. In particular, we simultaneously train the registration network and completion network using two coupled flows, one that register-and-complete, and one that complete-and-register, and encourage the two flows to produce a consistent result. We show that, compared with each separate flow, this two-flow training leads to robust and reliable tele-registration, and hence to a better point cloud prediction that completes the registered scans. It is also worth mentioning that each of the components in our neural network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both completion and registration.

Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic discriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously considered ânon-colorableâ (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114780","Rob Nowak, Melissa Schoenlein, Kevin Lande, Tim Rogers, Chris Thorstenson, Anna Bartel, and Maureen Stone for helpful discussions(grant numbers:BCS-1945303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552216","Visual Reasoning;Information Visualization;Visual Communication;Visual Encoding;Color Cognition","Color;Semantics;Visualization;Image color analysis;Encoding;Plastics;Visual communication","data visualisation;feature extraction;graph theory;image colour analysis;statistical analysis;statistical testing;visual perception","perceptual encoding systems;specific associations;encoding system;perceptual features;semantic discriminability theory posits;feature-concept association distributions;semantically discriminable colors;color-concept association distributions;bar graphs;visual communication","","","","41","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then context-compatible virtual objects that have similar geometric properties to the real ones can be automatically selected and placed into the virtual scene, based on learned object association relations and layout patterns from large amounts of indoor scene configurations.

Although automated techniques can be used to detect the existence of covariate shift, our goal is to help human users characterize the extent of covariate shift in large image datasets with interfaces that seamlessly integrate information obtained from the detection algorithms. In this paper, we design and evaluate a new visual interface that facilitates the comparison of the local distributions of training and test data. We conduct a quantitative user study on multi-attribute facial data to compare two different learned low-dimensional latent representations (pretrained ImageNet CNN vs. density ratio) and two user analytic workflows (nearest-neighbor vs. cluster-to-cluster). Our results indicate that the latent representation of our density ratio model, combined with a nearest-neighbor comparison, is the most effective at helping humans identify covariate shift.","","978-1-6654-3335-8","10.1109/VIS49827.2021.9623289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623289","","Training;Visualization;Conferences;Training data;Data visualization;Machine learning;Detection algorithms","face recognition;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);nearest neighbour methods","multiattribute facial data;image data;training data biases;localized covariate shift;contrastive identification;low-dimensional latent representation;machine learning;nearest-neighbor comparison","","","","21","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, for more complex use cases-e.g., remote database access and streaming data sources-developers must grapple with distributed data and asynchronous events. Currently, constructing these use cases is difficult and time-consuming; developers are forced to operationally program low-level details like asynchronous database querying and reactive event handling. This approach is in stark contrast to modern methods for browser-based interactive visualization, which feature high-level declarative specifications. In response, we present DIEL, a declarative framework that supports asynchronous events over distributed data. As in many declarative languages, DIEL developers specify only what data they want, rather than procedural steps for how to assemble it. Uniquely, DIEL models asynchronous events (e.g., user interactions, server responses) as streams of data that are captured in event logs. To specify the state of a visualization at any time, developers write declarative queries over the data and event logs; DIEL compiles and optimizes a corresponding dataflow graph, and automatically generates necessary low-level distributed systems details. We demonstrate DIEL'S performance and expressivity through example interactive visualizations that make diverse use of remote data and asynchronous events. We further evaluate DIEL'S usability using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, revealing wins such as ease of change, and compromises such as premature commitments.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114796","NSF(grant numbers:1564049,1564351,1942659,1845638,2106197,1452977,1939945,1940175,CCF-1730628); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552893","Interactive Visualization Toolkit/Library;Scalability;Asynchrony","Data visualization;Distributed databases;Databases;Programming;Libraries;Visual databases;Servers","data flow graphs;data visualisation;formal specification;interactive systems;program compilers;query processing;user interfaces","event logs;declarative queries;low-level distributed systems details;remote data;browser-based interactive visualization;high-level declarative specifications;declarative framework;declarative languages;DIEL usability;dataflow graph","","","","64","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, as the data properties have no direct correlation to the spatial variations, previous methods may be insufficient to reveal the dynamic range of spatial variations hidden in the data. To address the above issues, we conduct a pilot analysis with domain experts and summarize three requirements for the colormap adjustment process. Based on the requirements, we formulate colormap adjustment as an objective function, composed of a boundary term and a fidelity term, which is flexible enough to support interactive functionalities. We compare our approach with alternative methods under a quantitative measure and a qualitative user study (25 participants), based on a set of data with broad distribution diversity. We further evaluate our approach via three case studies with six domain experts.

Moreover, the theories are usually too abstract for understanding each concrete humor snippet. To fill in the gap, we develop DeHumor, a visual analytical system for analyzing humorous behaviors in public speaking. To intuitively reveal the building blocks of each concrete example, DeHumor decomposes each humorous video into multimodal features and provides inline annotations of them on the video script. In particular, to better capture the build-ups, we introduce content repetition as a complement to features introduced in theories of computational humor and visualize them in a context linking graph. To help users locate the punchlines that have the desired features to learn, we summarize the content (with keywords) and humor feature statistics on an augmented time matrix. With case studies on stand-up comedy shows and TED talks, we show that DeHumor is able to highlight various building blocks of humor examples.

The color transform network takes the target line art images as well as the line art and color images of the reference images as input, and generates corresponding target color images. To cope with the large differences between each target line art image and the reference color images, we propose a distance attention layer that utilizes non-local similarity matching to determine the region correspondences between the target image and the reference images and transforms the local color information from the references to the target. To ensure global color style consistency, we further incorporate Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with the transformation parameters obtained from a multiple-layer AdaIN that describes the global color style of the references, extracted by an embedder network. The temporal refinement network learns spatiotemporal features through 3D convolutions to ensure the temporal color consistency of the results.

We exemplify the flexibility of DRE by different architectures and loss functions, and benchmarked our method against the two most popular embedding methods, namely, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP). The proposed DRE method can map out-of-sample data and scale to extremely large datasets. Experiments on a range of public datasets demonstrated improved embedding performance in terms of local and global structure preservation, compared with other state-of-the-art embedding methods.

We discuss lessons learned from a case study designing VA tools for Canadian avalanche forecasters. Avalanche forecasting is a complex and collaborative risk-based decision-making and analysis domain, demanding experience and knowledge-based interpretation of human reported and uncertain data. Differences in reporting practices, organizational contexts, and the particularities of individual reports result in a variety of potential interpretations that have to be negotiated as part of the forecaster's sensemaking processes. We describe our preliminary research using glyphs to support sensemaking under ambiguity. Ambiguity is not unique to public avalanche forecasting. There are many other domains where the way data are measured and reported vary in ways not accounted explicitly in the data and require analysts to negotiate multiple potential meanings. We argue that ambiguity is under-served by visualization research and would benefit from more explicit VA support.","","978-1-7281-8014-4","10.1109/VIS47514.2020.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331311","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Visual analytics","Navigation;Visual analytics;Knowledge based systems;Data visualization;Collaboration;Tools;Forecasting","data analysis;data visualisation;decision making;knowledge based systems;risk management","VA tools;Canadian avalanche forecasters;complex risk-based decision-making;collaborative risk-based decision-making;knowledge-based interpretation;uncertain data;visualization research;visual analytics systems","","","","37","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Experiment 1, we compared pictograph arrays to more traditional bar and pie charts. We tested participants' ability to generate high-level insights following Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives via 6 free-response questions. We found that accuracy for extracting information and generating insights did not differ overall between the two versions. To explore the motivating differences between the designs, we conducted a second experiment where participants compared charts containing pictograph arrays to more traditional charts on 5 metrics and explained their reasoning. We found that some participants preferred the way that pictographs allowed them to envision the topic more easily, while others preferred traditional bar and pie charts because they seem less cluttered and faster to read. These results suggest that, at least in simple visualizations depicting part-to-whole relationships, the choice of using pictographs has little influence on sensemaking and insight extraction. When deciding whether to use pictograph arrays, designers should consider visual appeal, perceived comprehension time, ease of envisioning the topic, and clutteredness.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3092680","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465643","Infographics;pictographs;design;graph comprehension;understanding;casual sensemaking","Data visualization;Visualization;Taxonomy;Graphics;Bars;Task analysis;COVID-19","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Finally, using the 32 features as an input, we build a simple neural network to predict the perceptual distances between scatterplots that were previously scored by human annotators.

Similarity-preserving scatterplots created through a dimensionality reduction algorithm are a common visualization that is used in these cases. Previous studies investigated the effects of layout and image complexity on tasks like labeling. However, model evaluation has not been studied systematically. We present the results of an experiment studying the influence of image complexity and visual grouping of images on model accuracy estimation.

To mitigate this, we propose a novel method of controlling the intensity based on a pixel-parallel calculation for each projector in real-time with low latency. This parallel calculation leverages the insight that the projected pixels from different projectors in overlapping areas can be approximated independently if the pixel is sufficiently small relative to the surface structure. Additionally, our pixel-parallel calculation method allows a distributed system configuration, such that the number of projectors can be increased to form a network for high scalability. We demonstrate a seamless mapping into dynamic scenes at 360 fps with a 9.5-ms latency using ten cameras and four projectors.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3150488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714121","Projection mapping;Multi-projector;Parallel computing methodologies","Rendering (computer graphics);Low latency communication;Shape;Image color analysis;Geometry;Surface structures;Real-time systems","","","","","","43","IEEE","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These clusters can result in ambiguous connections that do not exist in the data. Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the layout to be computed as part of the bundling process. We devise a new bundling method, Edge-Path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-Path bundling takes a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-Path bundling does not incur independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally emerges from the model. Through metric evaluations, we demonstrate the advantages of Edge-Path bundling over other techniques.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114795","Vienna Science and Technology Fund(grant numbers:ICT19-035); UK Research and Innovation(grant numbers:EP/V033670/1); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:327352); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552919","Graph/network and tree data;algorithms;edge bundling","Layout;Image edge detection;Clutter;Windings;Roads;Visualization;Lakes","computational geometry;data visualisation;edge detection;graph theory;pattern clustering","Edge-Path bundling;independent edge ambiguities;edge bundling methods;directed edge bundling;ambiguous Edge bundling approach;Edge bundling techniques;edge clutter;previous bundling techniques","","","","57","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We attribute this to the high computational demand of DVR and the limited rendering budget available for VR systems. For a heavily fragment-bound method such as DVR, it is challenging to achieve the very high update rates essential for VR. We propose an acceleration technique designed to take advantage of the specific characteristics of HMD systems.

In this paper, we present FairRankVis, a visual analytics framework designed to enable the exploration of multi-class bias in graph mining algorithms. We support both group and individual fairness levels of comparison. Our framework is designed to enable model developers to compare multi-class fairness between algorithms (for example, comparing PageRank with a debiased PageRank algorithm) to assess the impacts of algorithmic debiasing with respect to group and individual fairness. We demonstrate our framework through two usage scenarios inspecting algorithmic fairness.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114850","U.S. Department of Homeland Security(grant numbers:2017-ST-061-QA0001,17STQAC00001-03-03); National Science Foundation Program(grant numbers:1939725); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552229","Graph ranking;fairness;visual analytics","Analytical models;Visual analytics;Machine learning algorithms;Task analysis;Data mining;Data models;Machine learning","data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;graph theory;recommender systems;search engines","employing fairness-aware algorithms;FairRankVis;visual analytics framework;multiclass bias;graph mining algorithms;model developers;multiclass fairness;debiased PageRank algorithm;algorithmic debiasing;algorithmic fairness;graph mining models;algorithmic bias;potential biases","","","","37","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present an algorithm for data reconnaissance through automatic visualization recommendation, GEViTRec. Our approach handles a broad variety of dataset types and automatically generates visually coherent combinations of charts, in contrast to existing systems that primarily focus on singleton visual encodings of tabular datasets. We automatically detect linkages across multiple input datasets by analyzing non-numeric attribute fields, creating a data source graph within which we analyze and rank paths. For each high-ranking path, we specify chart combinations with positional and color alignments between shared fields, using a gradual binding approach to transform initial partial specifications of singleton charts to complete specifications that are aligned and oriented consistently. A novel aspect of our approach is its combination of domain-agnostic elements with domain-specific information that is captured through a domain-specific visualization prevalence design space. Our implementation is applied to both synthetic data and real Ebola outbreak data.

It is therefore difficult to diagnose possible errors of GNNs. Despite many visual analytics studies being done on CNNs and RNNs, little research has addressed the challenges for GNNs. This paper fills the research gap with an interactive visual analysis tool, GNNLens, to assist model developers and users in understanding and analyzing GNNs. Specifically, Parallel Sets View and Projection View enable users to quickly identify and validate error patterns in the set of wrong predictions; Graph View and Feature Matrix View offer a detailed analysis of individual nodes to assist users in forming hypotheses about the error patterns. Since GNNs jointly model the graph structure and the node features, we reveal the relative influences of the two types of information by comparing the predictions of three models: GNN, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and GNN Without Using Features (GNNWUF).

Centered around this insight, we define the homogeneous neighborhood (HoNe) which stays clear of surface discontinuities, and associate each HoNe with a point whose geometry and normal orientation is mostly consistent with that of HoNe. Thus, we not only obtain initial estimates of the point normals by performing PCA on HoNes, but also for the first time optimize these initial point normals by learning the mapping from two proposed geometric descriptors to the ground-truth point normals. GeoDualCNN consists of two parallel branches that remove noise using the first geometric descriptor (a homogeneous height map, which encodes the point-position information), while preserving surface features using the second geometric descriptor (a homogeneous normal map, which encodes the point-normal information).

We conduct a qualitative evaluation of the GeoSneakPique that indicates the usefulness of the interface as well as opportunities for better supporting geospatial workflows in visual analysis tasks employing cognitive regions.","","978-1-6654-3335-8","10.1109/VIS49827.2021.9623324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623324","Data-driven scaffolds;cognitive region;Human-centered computing;Visualization","Measurement;Heart;Visualization;Graphical models;Image color analysis;Query processing;Urban areas","cognition;data visualisation;geographic information systems;query processing","GeoSneakPique;visual autocompletion;geospatial queries;data questions;geographic location;natural language;fuzzy cognitive regions;data distributions;absolute administrative location;mapping widget;NL query process;direct manipulation;data-driven guidance;spatial distributions;spatial selection;spatial definitions;subsequent queries;geospatial workflows;visual analysis tasks","","","","46","CCBY","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike the popular window propagation methods that partition mesh edges into intervals of varying lengths, our method places evenly-spaced, source-independent Steiner points on edges. Given a source vertex, our method constructs a Steiner-point graph that partitions the surface into mutually exclusive tracks, called geodesic tracks. Inside each triangle, the tracks form sub-regions in which the change of distance field is approximately linear. Our method does not require any pre-computation, and can effectively balance speed and accuracy. Experimental results show that with 5 Steiner points on each edge, the mean relative error is less than 0.3%. Thanks to a set of effective filtering rules, our method can eliminate lots of useless broadcast events. For a 1000K-face model, our method runs 10 times faster than the conventional Steiner point method that examines a complete graph of Steiner points in each triangle. We also observe that using more Steiner points increases the accuracy at only a small extra computational cost. Our method works well for meshes with poor triangulation and non-manifold configuration, which often poses challenges to the existing PDE methods. We show that geodesic tracks, as a new data structure that encodes rich information of discrete geodesics, support accurate geodesic path and isoline tracing, and efficient distance query. Our method can be easily extended to meshes with non-constant density functions and/or anisotropic metrics.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3109042","Singapore Ministry of Education Grants(grant numbers:RG20/20,T2EP20220-0014); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772016,61772318,62002190,62072284); the Key Program of Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020ZLYS01); NSF of Shandong Province China(grant numbers:ZR2020MF036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527080","Discrete geodesics;shortest paths;geodesic tracks;Steiner points;ridge points","Steiner trees;Approximation algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Faces;Measurement;Data structures;Computer science","","","","","","","IEEE","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We present a novel camera view generation method which maximizes the visible geometric attributes (segment shape and relative placement between segments). Camera views are created for individual segments and are used to determine local bending angles at each node by projecting them to 2D. The final embedding is generated by minimizing an energy function (the weights of which are user adjustable) based on branch length and the 2D angles, while avoiding intersections. The user can also interactively modify segment placement within the 2D embedding, and the overall embedding will update accordingly. A global to local interactive exploration is provided using hierarchical camera views that are created for subtrees within the structure.

In this work we explore techniques for high-performance rendering of tubes, such as streamtubes used for visualizing vector fields and fiber tracts from diffusion tensor MRI. We first present our method for generating a voxelization of the tubes, and then describe several methods for rendering: raytracing a SVO storing straight tube segments in the leaves, and hybrid raytracing/raycasting a SVO storing curved tube segments. We discuss the tradeoffs inherent in these different representations and compare the rendering techniques and results.

Concept-based explanations have recently become a popular approach for post-hoc interpretation of DNNs. However, identifying human-understandable visual concepts that affect model decisions is a challenging task that is not easily addressed with automatic approaches. We present a novel human-in-the-Ioop approach to generate user-defined concepts for model interpretation and diagnostics. Central to our proposal is the use of active learning, where human knowledge and feedback are combined to train a concept extractor with very little human labeling effort.

Through two case studies, we show how our approach helps analyze model behavior and extract human-friendly concepts for different machine learning tasks and datasets and how to use these concepts to understand the predictions, compare model performance and make suggestions for model refinement.

More importantly, by identifying visual concepts that negatively affect model performance, we develop the corresponding data augmentation strategy that consistently improves model performance.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552218","Visual Data Exploration;Deep Neural Network;Model Interpretation;Explainable AI","Visualization;Data models;Analytical models;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Deep learning;Task analysis","data visualisation;decision making;deep learning (artificial intelligence);explanation;human computer interaction;interactive systems","interpretable concepts;deep learning models;deep neural networks;DNN;critical decision making;concept-based explanations;post-hoc interpretation;human-understandable visual concepts;user-defined concepts;model interpretation;concept extractor;model behavior analysis;machine learning;active learning;human-in-the-loop extraction;human-friendly concept extraction;model diagnostics","Computer Graphics;Deep Learning;Humans;Machine Learning;Neural Networks, Computer","","","55","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data comics are an effective and versatile means for visual communication, leveraging the power of sequential narration and combined textual and visual content, while providing an overview of the storyline through panels assembled in expressive layouts. While a powerful static storytelling medium that works well on paper support, adding interactivity to data comics can enable non-linear storytelling, personalization, levels of details, explanations, and potentially enriched user experiences. This paper introduces a set of operations tailored to support data comics narrative goals that go beyond the traditional linear, immutable storyline curated by a story author. The goals and operations include adding and removing panels into pre-defined layouts to support branching, change of perspective, or access to detail-on-demand, as well as providing and modifying data, and interacting with data representation, to support personalization and reader-defined data focus. We propose a lightweight specification language, COMICSCRIPT, for designers to add such interactivity to static comics. To assess the viability of our authoring process, we recruited six professional illustrators, designers and data comics enthusiasts and asked them to craft an interactive comic, allowing us to understand authoring workflow and potential of our approach.

Examples include control-flow graphs in programs and semantic scene graphs in images. Identifying subgraph patterns in graphs is an important approach to understand their structural properties. We propose a visual analytics system GraphQ to support human-in-the-loop, example-based, subgraph pattern search in a database containing many individual graphs. To support fast, interactive queries, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode a graph as fixed-length latent vector representation, and perform subgraph matching in the latent space. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is still difficult to obtain accurate one-to-one node correspondences in the matching results that are crucial for visualization and interpretation. We, therefore, propose a novel GNN for node-alignment called NeuroAlign, to facilitate easy validation and interpretation of the query results. GraphQ provides a visual query interface with a query editor and a multi-scale visualization of the results, as well as a user feedback mechanism for refining the results with additional constraints. We demonstrate GraphQ through two example usage scenarios: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows and semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that NeuroAlign achieves 19%-29% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to baseline GNN and provides up to 100Ã speedup compared to combinatorial algorithms. Our qualitative study with domain experts confirms the effectiveness for both usage scenarios.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552902","Graph;Graph Neural Network;Representation Learning;Visual Query Interface","Task analysis;Semantics;Visual analytics;Graph neural networks;Computational modeling;Visual databases;Pattern matching","data structures;data visualisation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;query processing;vectors","interactive visual pattern search;graph data;graph representation learning;ubiquitous data structure;control-flow graphs;semantic scene graphs;structural properties;visual analytics system GraphQ;subgraph pattern search;interactive queries;graph neural networks;fixed-length latent vector representation;subgraph matching;latent space;node correspondences;node-alignment;visual query interface;query editor;multiscale visualization;semantic scene graph search;NeuroAlign","","","","83","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they visualize state changes as either slope or difference of bars, which has been proved less effective for quantitative comparison. Also, both visual designs suffer from visual clutter issues with an increasing number of data items. In this paper, we propose Intercept Graph, a novel visual design to facilitate effective interactive comparison of state changes. Specifically, a radial design is proposed to visualize the starting and ending states of each data item and the line segment length explicitly encodes the âstate change By interactively adjusting the radius of the inner circular axis, Intercept Graph can smoothly filter the large state changes and magnify the difference between similar state changes, mitigating the visual clutter issues and enhancing the effective comparison of state changes.

Given an input color image, this seminal work tries to hide the color information into its grayscale counterpart while making it hard to recognize any anomalies. This powerful functionality is enabled by training a hiding sub-network and restoring sub-network in an end-to-end way. Despite its expressive results, two key limitations exist: 1) The restored color image often suffers from some noticeable visual artifacts in the smooth regions. 2) It is very sensitive to JPEG compression, i.e., the original color information cannot be well recovered once the intermediate grayscale image is compressed by JPEG. To overcome these two limitations, this paper introduces adversarial training and JPEG simulator respectively. Specifically, two auxiliary adversarial networks are incorporated to make the intermediate grayscale images and final restored color images indistinguishable from normal grayscale and color images. And the JPEG simulator is utilized to simulate real JPEG compression during the online training so that the hiding and restoring sub-networks can automatically learn to be JPEG robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the original invertible grayscale work both qualitatively and quantitatively while ensuring the JPEG robustness. We further show that the proposed framework can be applied under different types of grayscale constraints and achieve excellent results.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3088531","Anhui Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2008085QF296); Anhui Initiative in Quantum Information Technologies(grant numbers:AHY15040); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002334,62072421,U20B2047); Central University Basic Research Fund of China(grant numbers:WK2100000018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453114","Invertible Grayscale;Adversarial Training;JPEG Robust","Gray-scale;Transform coding;Image color analysis;Image restoration;Color;Training;Image coding","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

When a series of high-dimensional datasets, such as datasets changing over time, is projected independently using t-SNE, misaligned layouts are obtained. Even items with identical features across datasets are projected to different locations, making the technique unsuitable for comparison tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce edge similarity, which captures the similarities between two adjacent time frames based on the Graphlet Frequency Distribution (GFD). We then integrate a novel loss term into the t-SNE loss function, which we call vector constraints, to preserve the vectors between projected points across the projections, allowing these points to serve as visual landmarks for direct comparisons between projections. Using synthetic datasets whose ground-truth structures are known, we show that Joint t-SNE outperforms existing techniques, including Dynamic t-SNE, in terms of local coherence error, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and neighborhood preservation.

However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews.

We first employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the physical parameters of gaseous phenomena in Eulerian settings, then we can use the just-learnt parameters to re-simulate (with or without artists' guidance) for specific scenes with flexible coupling effects. Next, a second CNN is adopted to reconstruct the high-resolution velocity field to guide a fast re-simulation on the finer grid, achieving richer and more realistic details with little extra computational expense. From the perspective of physics-based simulation, our trained networks respect temporal coherence and physical constraints. From the perspective of the data-driven machine-learning approaches, our network design aims at extracting a meaningful parameters and reconstructing visually realistic details.

Current machine learning models for simulator sickness prediction ignore the underlying interdependencies and correlations across multiple visual features which may lead to simulator sickness. We propose a model for sickness prediction by automatic learning and adaptive integrating multi-level mappings from stereoscopic video features to simulator sickness scores. Firstly, saliency, optical flow and disparity features are extracted from videos to reflect the factors causing simulator sickness, including human attention area, motion velocity and depth information. Then, these features are embedded and fed into a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) to extract the underlying multi-level knowledge which includes low-level and higher-order visual concepts, and global image descriptor. Finally, an attentional mechanism is exploited to adaptively fuse multi-level information with attentional weights for sickness score estimation. The proposed model is trained by an end-to-end approach and validated over a public dataset.

To address this problem, we propose a novel method to generate plausible single-bounce indirect illumination for dynamic scenes in interactive framerates. In our method, we first compute direct illumination and then use a lightweight neural network to predict screen space indirect illumination. Our neural network is designed explicitly with bilateral convolution layers and takes only essential information as input (direct illumination, surface normals, and 3D positions). Also, our network maintains the coherence between adjacent image frames efficiently without heavy recurrent connections.

However, it is challenging to transform particle data into latent representations, since the convolution neural networks used in prior studies require the data presented in regular grids. In this paper, we adopt Geometric Convolution, a neural network building block designed for 3D point clouds, to create latent representations for scientific particle data. These latent representations capture both the particle positions and their physical attributes in the local neighborhood so that features can be extracted by clustering in the latent space, and tracked by applying tracking algorithms such as mean-shift.

Given several candidate areas around the host object in the scene, our system predicts the partner object whose geometry fits well to the host object.

Pairwise comparisons between contrasting subject groups (e.g., the diseased and the healthy controls) are normally performed. The underlying neuroimaging and brain network construction process is assumed to have 100% fidelity.

In this work, we present MV^2Net, a visual analytics system that tightly integrates multi-variate multi-view visualization for brain network comparison with an interactive wrangling mechanism to deal with data uncertainty. On the analysis side, the system integrates multiple extraction methods on diffusion and geometric connectivity features of brain networks, an anomaly detection algorithm for data quality assessment, single- and multi-connection feature selection methods for bio-marker detection. On the visualization side, novel designs are introduced which optimize network comparisons among contrasting subject groups and related connectivity features.

Handling 3D data is more challenging due to its irregularity and complexity, and there is a growing interest in adapting deep learning techniques to the 3D domain. A recent successful approach called MeshCNN consists of a set of convolutional and pooling operators applied to the edges of triangular meshes. While this approach produced superb results in classification and segmentation of 3D shapes, it can only be applied to edges of a mesh, which can constitute a disadvantage for applications where the focuses are other primitives of the mesh. In this study, we propose face-based and vertex-based operators for mesh convolutional networks. We design two novel architectures based on the MeshCNN network that can operate on faces and vertices of a mesh, respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed face-based architecture outperforms the original MeshCNN implementation in mesh classification and mesh segmentation, setting the new state of the art on benchmark datasets. In addition, we extend the vertex-based operator to fit in the Point2Mesh model for mesh reconstruction from clean, noisy, and incomplete point clouds. While no statistically significant performance improvements are observed, the model training and inference time are reduced by the proposed approach by 91% and 20%, respectively, as compared with the original Point2Mesh model.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3129156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9619951","Class;IEEEtran;L A T E X;paper;style;template;typesetting","Conferences;Portable document format;Indexes;Typesetting;Loading;Web sites;Warranties","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In the first step, we compile information about the model from heterogeneous sources into a story graph. We combine local knowledge with external sources to complete the story graph and enrich the final result. In the second step, we synthesize a narrative, i.e., story elements presented in sequence, using the story graph. We then traverse the story graph and generate a virtual tour, using automated camera and visualization transitions.

Hence, the ability to smartly arrange textual labels and packing graphs within a certain screen space is therefore desired to successfully convey the attribute data . Here we propose to hierarchically partition the input screen space using Voronoi tessellations in multiple levels of detail. In our method, the position of textual labels is guided by the blending of constrained forces and the forces derived from centroidal Voronoi cells. The proposed algorithm considers three main factors: (1) area balancing, (2) schematized space partitioning, and (3) hairball management. We primarily focus on area balancing, which aims to allocate a uniform area for each textual label in the diagram. We achieve this by first untangling a general graph to a clustered graph through textual label duplication, and then coupling with spanning-tree-like visual integration.

Our approach is flexible and can be used to optimize several criteria that have already been considered earlier (e.g., obtaining ideal edge lengths, stress, neighborhood preservation) as well as other criteria which have not yet been explicitly optimized in such fashion (e.g., node resolution, angular resolution, aspect ratio). The approach is scalable and can handle large graphs. A variation of the underlying approach can also be used to optimize many desirable properties in planar graphs, while maintaining planarity. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effectiveness of (SGD)^2: we analyze the interactions between criteria, measure the quality of layouts generated from (SGD)^2 as well as the runtime behavior, and analyze the impact of sample sizes.

In this paper, we introduce NeuRegenerate, a novel end-to-end framework for the prediction and visualization of changes in neural fiber morphology within a subject across specified age-timepoints. To predict projections, we present neuReGANerator, a deep-learning network based on cycle-consistent generative adversarial network that translates features of neuronal structures across age-timepoints for large brain microscopy volumes. We improve the reconstruction quality of the predicted neuronal structures by implementing a density multiplier and a new loss function, called the hallucination loss. Moreover, to alleviate artifacts that occur due to tiling of large input volumes, we introduce a spatial-consistency module in the training pipeline of neuReGANerator. Finally, to visualize the change in projections, predicted using neuReGANerator, NeuRegenerate offers two modes: (i) neuroCompare to simultaneously visualize the difference in the structures of the neuronal projections, from two age domains (using structural view and bounded view), and (ii) neuroMorph, a vesselness-based morphing technique to interactively visualize the transformation of the structures from one age-timepoint to the other.

We present Neurocartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. Neurocartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting âdog facesâ of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting âdog faceâ and âdog tailâ are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs' relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. Neurocartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system's tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts.

It would seem then that zines would make an ideal vehicle for the recent interest in applying feminist or humanist ideas to visualization. Yet, there has been little work combining visualization and zines. In this paper we explore the potential of this intersection by analyzing examples of zines that use data graphics and by describing the pedagogical value that they can have in a visualization classroom.

We present a deep neural network that can compensate for defocus blur in dynamic PM. The primary contribution of this paper is a unique network structure that consists of an extractor and a generator. The extractor explicitly estimates a defocus blur map and a luminance attenuation map. These maps are then injected into the middle layers of the generator network that computes the compensation image. We also propose a pseudo-projection technique for synthesizing physically plausible training data, considering the geometric misregistration that potentially happens in actual PM systems. We conducted simulation and actual PM experiments and confirmed that: (1) the proposed network structure is more suitable than a simple, more general structure for projector deblurring; (2) the network trained with the proposed pseudo-projection technique can compensate projection images for defocus blur artifacts in dynamic PM; and (3) the network supports the translation speed of the surface movement within a certain range that covers normal human motions.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3150465","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP20H05958); JST; PRESTO(grant numbers:JPMJPR19J2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714047","Projector deblurring;dynamic projection mapping;deep neural network","Generators;Attenuation;Cameras;Deep learning;Calibration;Neural networks;Estimation","","","Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer","","","52","CCBY","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These brain regions are typically represented by atlases that capture general trends over large populations. Despite being indispensable to neuroimaging experts, population-level atlases do not capture individual differences in functional organization. In this work, we present an interactive visualization method, PRAGMA, that allows domain experts to derive scan-specific parcellations from established atlases. PRAGMA features a user-driven, hierarchical clustering scheme for defining temporally correlated parcels in varying granularity. The visualization design supports the user in making decisions on how to perform clustering, namely when to expand, collapse, or merge parcels. This is accomplished through a set of linked and coordinated views for understanding the user's current hierarchy, assessing intra-cluster variation, and relating parcellations to an established atlas. We assess the effectiveness of PRAGMA through a user study with four neuroimaging domain experts, where our results show that PRAGMA shows the potential to enable exploration of individualized and state-specific brain parcellations and to offer interesting insights into functional brain networks.","","978-1-7281-8014-4","10.1109/VIS47514.2020.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331292","Human-centered modeling;neuroimage analysis;functional parcellation;brain mapping","Neuroimaging;Visualization;Conferences;Sociology;Organizations;Market research;Statistics","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;data visualisation;medical image processing;neurophysiology;pattern clustering","neuroimaging domain experts;PRAGMA;functional brain networks;functional brain parcellations;human brain;functionally-meaningful regions;cognitive behaviors;brain regions;interactive visualization method;scan-specific parcellations;hierarchical clustering scheme;visualization design","","","","36","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recognizing that previous approaches to FEM visualization depend on efficiently updating computed positions within a mesh, we took an existing visualization domain-specific language, and added a mesh position type and associated arithmetic operators. These are orthogonal to the visualization method itself, so existing programs for visualizing regular grid data work, with minimal changes, on higher-order FEM data.

VE geometry close to the user is rendered conventionally, from the user's viewpoint, to anchor the user, avoiding disorientation and simulator sickness. Given a viewpoint, residual occlusions are quantified and localized as VE voxels that cannot be seen from the given viewpoint but that can be seen from nearby viewpoints. This residual occlusion quantification and localization helps the user ascertain that a VE region has been explored exhaustively. The occlusion management approach was tested in three controlled studies, which confirmed the exploration efficiency benefit of the approach, and in perceptual experiments, which confirmed that exploration efficiency does not come at the cost of reducing spatial awareness and sense of presence, or of increasing simulator sickness.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3053287","National Key RD plan(grant numbers:2019YFC1521102); funding of Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772051,61932003); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L182016); Beijing Program for International ST Cooperation Project(grant numbers:Z191100001619003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9332290","VR exploration;fine grain disocclusion;multiperspective visualization;graph camera;occlusion quantification","Visualization;Legged locomotion;Geometry;Teleportation;Cameras;Navigation;Virtual environments","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In interactive applications, the labeling method responsible for positioning the labels should not take the resources from the application itself. In other words, the labeling method should provide the result as fast as possible. In this work, we propose a greedy point-feature labeling method running on GPU. In contrast to existing methods that position the labels sequentially, the proposed method positions several labels in parallel. Yet, we guarantee that the positioned labels will not overlap, nor will they overlap important visual features. When the proposed method is searching for the label position of a point-feature, the available label candidates are evaluated with respect to overlaps with important visual features, conflicts with label candidates of other point-features, and their ambiguity. The evaluation of each label candidate is done in constant time independently from the number of point-features, the number of important visual features, and the resolution of the created image.

Rowever, existing tet marching techniques do not easily generalize to rays with arbitrary origin and direction required for advanced shading effects or non-convex meshes. Additionally, the memory footprint of these methods may exceed GPU memory limits. Interactive performance and high image quality are opposing goals. Our approach significantly lowers the burden to render unstructured datasets with high image fidelity while maintaining real-time and interactive performance even for large datasets. To this end, we leverage hardware-accelerated ray tracing to find entry and exit faces for a given ray into a volume and utilize a compact mesh representation to enable the efficient marching of arbitrary rays, thus allowing for advanced shading effects that ultimately yields more convincing and grounded images. Our approach is also robust, supporting both convex and non-convex unstructured meshes.

Most of the existing methods are capable of processing only scenes captured under a fixed viewpoint. In contrast, this paper proposes a new framework for shadow detection in live outdoor videos captured under moving viewpoints. The framework splits each frame into a tracked region, which is the region tracked from the previous video frame through optical flow analysis, and an emerging region, which is newly introduced into the scene due to the moving viewpoint. The framework subsequently extracts features based on the intensity profiles surrounding the boundaries of candidate shadow regions. These features are then utilized to both correct erroneous shadow boundaries for the tracked region and to detect shadow boundaries for the emerging region by a Bayesian learning module. To remove spurious shadows, spatial layout constraints are further considered for emerging regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art shadow tracking and detection algorithms on a variety of challenging cases in real time, including shadows on backgrounds with complex textures, nonplanar shadows, fast-moving shadows with changing typologies, and shadows cast by nonrigid objects. The quantitative experiments show that our method outperforms the best existing method, achieving a 33.3% increase in the average F_{measure}.

We solve these issues with deep neural networks to learn the regression from the simulation flux values to the LC coils' 3D configuration, which can be applied to the actual LC coils at any location and orientation within the capture volume. To cope with the influence of system noise and the dead-angle limitation caused by the characteristics of the hardware and sensing principle, we propose a structure-aware temporal bilateral filter for reconstructing motion sequences. Our method can track various movements, including fingers that manipulate objects, beetles that move inside a vivarium with leaves and soil, and the flow of opaque fluid. Since no power supply is needed for the lightweight wireless markers, our method can robustly track movements for a very long time, making it suitable for various types of observations whose tracking is difficult with existing motion-tracking systems.

Different flavors of sampling algorithms exist to sample the high-resolution scientific data, while preserving important data properties required for subsequent analyses. However, most of these sampling algorithms are designed for univariate data and cater to post-hoc analyses of single variables. In this work, we propose a multivariate sampling strategy which preserves the original variable relationships and enables different multivariate analyses directly on the sampled data. Our proposed strategy utilizes principal component analysis to capture the variance of multivariate data and can be built on top of any existing state-of-the-art sampling algorithms for single variables. In addition, we also propose variants of different data partitioning schemes (regular and irregular) to efficiently model the local multivariate relationships. Using two real-world multivariate data sets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed multivariate sampling strategy with respect to its data reduction capabilities as well as the ease of performing efficient post-hoc multivariate analyses.","","978-1-7281-8014-4","10.1109/VIS47514.2020.00015","Research and Development; U.S. Department of Energy; Office of Science; Biological and Environmental Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331314","","Conferences;Computational modeling;Data visualization;Data models;Supercomputers;Partitioning algorithms;Principal component analysis","data analysis;data reduction;principal component analysis;sampling methods","high-resolution scientific data;data properties;subsequent analyses;univariate data;sampled data;sampling algorithms;data partitioning schemes;real-world multivariate data sets;data reduction capabilities;relationship-aware multivariate sampling strategy;scientific simulation data;data reduction method;data summarization method;principal component analysis","","","","27","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More specifically, we complete the missing parts of the objects in a conditional manner, where the partial or completed point cloud of the other object is used as an additional input to help predict the missing parts. Based on the idea of conditional completion, we further propose a two-path network, which is guided by a consistency loss between different sequences of completion. Our method can handle difficult cases where the objects heavily occlude each other. Also, it only requires a small set of training data to reconstruct the interaction area compared to existing completion approaches.

An existing ranking of these visual channels is based on how accurately participants could report the ratio between two depicted values. There is an assumption that this ranking should hold for different tasks and for different numbers of marks. However, there is surprisingly little existing work that tests this assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict more than two values. To simulate the information extracted from a glance at a visualization, we instead asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory after they were shown the visualization. These values could be shown in a bar graph (position (bar)), line graph (position (line)), heat map (luminance), bubble chart (area), misaligned bar graph (length), or âwind mapâ (angle). With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we show how the rank positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or 8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new probabilistic ranking was highly inconsistent for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel choice had an order of magnitude more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the series (e.g., more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g., small values were systematically overestimated). Every visual channel was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with established limits on visual memory. These results point to the need for a body of empirical studies that move beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for reliably ranking the quality of a visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs), timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of values (from a handful, to thousands).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114684","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:BCS-1653457,IIS-1901485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557878","DataType Agnostic;Human-Subjects Quantitative Studies;Perception & Cognition;Charts, Diagrams, and Plots","Task analysis;Visualization;Bars;Data visualization;Memory management;Measurement uncertainty;Correlation","Bayes methods;data visualisation;graph theory;probability;statistical analysis","real-world visualizations;rank positions;visual channels;visual memory;wind map;misaligned bar graph;channel choice;Bayesian multilevel modeling approach","","","","87","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our core technical contribution is a view-surface collaborative mesh generative network. Initially, a Graph Convolutional Neural Network(GCNN) is trained to learn the deformation of a template mesh to fit the shape of sketches, giving rise to a coarse model. It is then projected into vertex maps where image-to-image translation networks are performed for detail inference. After back-projecting the inferred details onto the meshed surface, a new GCNN is trained for further detail refinement. The modules of view-based detail inference and surface-based detail refinement are conducted in an alternating cascaded fashion, collaboratively improving the model.

Most AR systems benefit from computer vision (CV) algorithms to detect, classify, or recognize physical objects for augmentation. A widely used acceleration method for mobile AR is to offload the compute-intensive tasks (<italic>e.g.</italic>, CV algorithms) to the network edge. However, we show that the end-to-end latency, an important metric of mobile AR, may dramatically increase when offloading AR tasks from a large number of concurrent users to the edge. SEAR tackles this scalability issue through the innovation of a lightweight collaborative local caching scheme. Our key observation is that nearby AR users may share some common interests, and may even have overlapped views to augment (<italic>e.g.</italic>, when playing a multi-user AR game). Thus, SEAR opportunistically exchanges the results of offloaded AR tasks among users when feasible and leverages compute resources on mobile devices to relieve, if necessary, the edge workload by intelligently reusing these results. We build a prototype of SEAR to demonstrate its efficacy in scaling AR experiences. We conduct extensive evaluations through both real-world experiments and trace-driven simulations.

In this paper, we cast the problem of point cloud generation as a topological representation learning problem. To infer the representative information of 3D shapes in the latent space, we propose a hierarchical mixture model that integrates self-attention with an inference tree structure for constructing a point cloud generator. Based on this, we design a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that is capable to generate realistic point clouds in an unsupervised manner. The proposed adversarial framework (SG-GAN) relies on self-attention mechanism and Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to hierarchically infer the latent topology of 3D shapes. Embedding and transferring the global topology information in a tree framework allows our model to capture and enhance the structural connectivity. Furthermore, the proposed architecture endows our model with partially generating 3D structures. Finally, we propose two gradient penalty methods to stabilize the training of SG-GAN and overcome the possible mode collapse of GAN networks. To demonstrate the performance of our model, we present both quantitative and qualitative evaluations and show that SG-GAN is more efficient in training and it exceeds the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud generation.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3069195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9387601","Generative Adversarial Network;Graph Convolution Network;binary tree;self-attention;3D shape generation;point cloud learning;gradient penalty","Three-dimensional displays;Gallium nitride;Training;Shape;Generative adversarial networks;Solid modeling;Convolution","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Because these attributes allow visualization creators to focus on design on implementation details, tools built on top of SVG, such as D3.js, are essential to the visualization community. However, slow SVG rendering can limit designs by effectively capping the number of on-screen data points, and this can force visualization creators to switch to Canvas or WebGL. These are less flexible (e.g., no search or styling via CSS), and harder to learn. We introduce Scalable Scalable Vector Graphics (SSVG) to reduce these limitations and allow complex and smooth visualizations to be created with SVG. SSVG automatically translates interactive SVG visualizations into a dynamic virtual DOM (VDOM) to bypass the browser's slow âto specificationâ rendering by intercepting JavaScript function calls. De-coupling the SVG visualization specification from SVG rendering, and obtaining a dynamic VDOM, creates flexibility and opportunity for visualization system research. SSVG uses this flexibility to free up the main thread for more interactivity and renders the visualization with Canvas or WebGL on a web worker. Together, these concepts create a drop-in JavaScript library which can improve rendering performance by 3-9X with only one line of code added. To demonstrate applicability, we describe the use of SSVG on many example visualizations including published visualization research.

In this work, we present SeamlessGAN,a method capable of automatically generating tileable texture maps from a single input exemplar. In contrast to most existing methods, focused solely on solving the synthesis problem, our work tackles both problems, synthesis and tileability, simultaneously. Our key idea isto realize that tiling a latent space within a generative network trained using adversarial expansion techniques produces outputs with continuity at the seam intersection that can be then be turned into tileable images by cropping the central area. Since not every value of the latent space is valid to produce high-quality outputs, we leverage the discriminator as a perceptual error metric capable of identifying artifact-free textures during a sampling process. Further, in contrast to previous work on deep texture synthesis, our model is designed and optimized to work with multi-layered texture representations, enabling textures composed of multiple maps such as albedo, normals, etc. We extensively test our design choices for the network architecture, loss function, and sampling parameters. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that our approach outperforms previous methods and works for textures of different types.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3143615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684694","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural network;Machine vision;Image texture;Graphics;Computational photography","Measurement;Crops;Training;Semantics;Generative adversarial networks;Estimation;Virtual environments","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we present a novel approach towards the study of electronic transitions based on the visual analysis of a bivariate field, namely the electron density in the hole and particle Natural Transition Orbital (NTO). The visual analysis focuses on the continuous scatter plots (CSPs) of the bivariate field linked to their spatial domain. The method supports selections in the CSP visualized as fiber surfaces in the spatial domain, the grouping of atoms, and segmentation of the density fields to peel the CSP.

Recently, expressive nonlinear models are employed to support these tasks. However, the interpretation of these human-steered nonlinear models during human-in-the-loop analysis has not been explored. To address this problem, we present a new visual explanation design called semantic explanation. Semantic explanation visualizes model behaviors in a manner that is similar to usersâ direct projection manipulations. This design conforms to the spatial analytic process and enables analysts better understand the updated model in response to their interactions.

In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is âalignedâ with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations.

Given a set of star glyphs associated to multiple class labels, we propose to use shape context descriptors to measure the perceptual distance between pairs of glyphs, and use the derived silhouette coefficient to measure the perception of class separability within the entire set. To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes.

One common task of visual analysis with multiple views is to relate data across different views. For example, to identify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social network graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search for and read relevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily relies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking), which may require significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously selecting elements in one view, and then observing and following elements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a visual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship explorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with identified user tasks regarding the use of cross-view data relationships. SightBi formalizes cross-view data relationships as biclusters, computes them from a dataset, and uses a bi-context design that highlights creating stand-alone relationship-views. This helps preserve existing views and offers an overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user exploration. Moreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple views by using newly created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate the usefulness of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data relationships.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114801","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-2002082,SMA-2022443); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9555226","Cross-view data relationship;multi-view visualization;bicluster;visual analytics","Visualization;Data visualization;Tools;Task analysis;Layout;Sun;Bioinformatics","data analysis;data visualisation;pattern clustering","multiple-view visualization;cross-view data relationship explorations;SightBi;biclusters;visual analysis tools;data sensemaking;visual analytics;bi-context design;relationship views","Computer Graphics;Humans","","","74","IEEE","30 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike previous CNN-based methods that bypass handling non-Euclidean mesh data by reshaping hand-crafted geometric features into regular grids, we explore the non-uniform and irregular structure of mesh itself in its dual space and exploit graph neural networks for effective geometric feature learning. To address the crowded teeth issues and incomplete segmentation that commonly exist in previous methods, we design a two-branch network, one of which predicts a segmentation label for each facet while the other regresses each facet an offset away from its tooth centroid. Clustering are later conducted on offset-shifted locations, enabling both the separation of adjoining teeth and the adjustment of incompletely segmented teeth. Exploiting GNN for directly processing mesh data frees us from extracting hand-crafted feature, and largely speeds up the inference procedure.

In contrast with the psychophysical experiments, it is observed that the magnitude data is more important to these computational feature sets than the phase data. We hypothesise that this inconsistency is due to the difference between the abilities of humans and the computational feature sets to utilise phase data. This motivates us to investigate the application of the 51 feature sets to phase-only images in addition to their use on the original data set. This investigation is extended to exploit Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features.

Existing readability metrics fall short in three ways. The many count-based metrics such as edge-edge or node-edge crossings simply provide integer counts, missing the opportunity to quantify the amount of overlap between items, which may vary in size, at a more fine-grained level. Current metrics focus solely on single-level topological structure, ignoring the possibility of multi-level structure such as large and thus highly salient metanodes. Most current metrics focus on the measurement of clutter in the form of crossings and overlaps, and do not take into account the trade-off between the clutter and the information sparsity of the drawing, which we refer to as sprawl. We propose an area-aware approach to clutter metrics that tracks the extent of geometric overlaps between node-node, node-edge, and edge-edge pairs in detail. It handles variable-size nodes and explicitly treats metanodes and leaf nodes uniformly. We call the combination of a sprawl metric and an area-aware clutter metric a sprawlter metric. We present an instantiation of the sprawlter metrics featuring a formal and thorough discussion of the crucial component, the penalty mapping function.

A topological simplification of such a graph representation induces a simplification of the hypergraph. In simplifying a hypergraph, we allow vertices to be combined if they belong to almost the same set of hyperedges, and hyperedges to be merged if they share almost the same set of vertices. Our proposed approaches are general, mathematically justifiable, and put vertex simplification and hyperedge simplification in a unifying framework.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3153895","DOE(grant numbers:DE-SC0021015); NSF(grant numbers:IIS 1513616); Battelle(grant numbers:DE-ACO6-76RL01830); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721603","Hypergraph simplification;hypergraph visualization;graph simplification;topological data analysis","Visualization;Data visualization;Encoding;Bipartite graph;Data analysis;Clutter;Pipelines","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We propose an approach here that generates backbone and dense skeletons by shape input, and then extends the backbone branches via skeleton grafting from the dense skeleton to ensure a well-integrated output. Based on our evaluation, the generated skeletons best depict the shapes at levels that are similar to human perception. To evaluate and fully express the properties of the extracted skeletons, we introduce two potential functions within the high-order matching protocol to improve the accuracy of skeleton-based matching. These two functions fuse the similarities between skeleton graphs and geometrical relations characterized by multiple skeleton endpoints.

Regardless of how effective a visualization is, providing equal access for blind users requires a paradigm shift for the visualization research community. To enact such a shift, it is not sufficient to treat visualization accessibility as merely another technical problem to overcome. Instead, supporting the millions of blind and visually impaired users around the world who have equally valid needs for data analysis as sighted individuals requires a respectful, equitable, and holistic approach that includes all users from the onset. In this paper, we draw on accessibility research methodologies to make inroads towards such an approach. We first identify the people who have specific insight into how blind people perceive the world: orientation and mobility (O&M) experts, who are instructors that teach blind individuals how to navigate the physical world using non-visual senses. We interview 10 O&M expertsâall of them blindâto understand how best to use sensory substitution other than the visual sense for conveying spatial layouts. Finally, we investigate our qualitative findings using thematic analysis. While blind people in general tend to use both sound and touch to understand their surroundings, we focused on auditory affordances and how they can be used to make data visualizations accessibleâusing sonification and auralization. However, our experts recommended supporting a combination of sensesâsound and touchâto make charts accessible as blind individuals may be more familiar with exploring tactile charts. We report results on both sound and touch affordances, and conclude by discussing implications for accessible visualization for blind individuals.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114829","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552177","Accessibility;blind users;sonification;visualization;spatial layouts;sound perception","Data visualization;Visualization;Interviews;Blindness;Training;Navigation;Layout","data analysis;data visualisation;handicapped aids","data visualizations;sensory substitution;data analysis;visualization accessibility;blind impaired users;visually impaired users;orientation and mobility experts;O&M experts","Blindness;Computer Graphics;Humans;Touch;Vision, Ocular;Visually Impaired Persons","","","84","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The âeffective surface area,â the surface area accessible to the airflow, is typically measured using a permeametry apparatus that relates the flow conductance to the permeable surface area via the Carman-Kozeny equation. This equation allows calculating the flow rate of a fluid flowing through the granules packed in the sample for a given pressure drop. However, Carman-Kozeny makes inherent assumptions about tunnel shapes and flow paths that may not accurately hold in situations where the particles possess a wide distribution in shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios, as is true with many powdered systems of technological and commercial interest. To address this challenge, we replicate these measurements virtually on micro-CT images of the powdered material, introducing a new Pore Network Model based on the skeleton of the Morse-Smale complex. Pores are identified as basins of the complex, their incidence encodes adjacency, and the conductivity of the capillary between them is computed from the cross-section at their interface. We build and solve a resistive network to compute an approximate laminar fluid flow through the pore structure. We provide two means of estimating flow-permeable surface area: (i) by direct computation of conductivity, and (ii) by identifying dead-ends in the flow coupled with isosurface extraction and the application of the Carman-Kozeny equation, with the aim of establishing consistency over a range of particle shapes, sizes, porosity levels, and void distribution patterns.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114819","Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-FE0031880); Exascale Computing Project(grant numbers:17-SC-20-SC); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration; NSF OAC(grant numbers:1842042,1941085); NSF CMMI(grant numbers:1629660); U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory(grant numbers:DE-AC52-07NA27344); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645370","Physical and Environmental Sciences;Computational Topology-based Techniques;Data Abstractions and Types;Scalar Field Data;Pore Network Model;Morse-Smale Complex","Shape;Mathematical models;Surface treatment;Powders;Computational modeling;Area measurement;Particle measurements","computerised tomography;flow simulation;flow through porous media;geophysical fluid dynamics;granular materials;laminar flow;permeability;porosity;porous materials;voids (solid)","physical testing;Topology-based Model;packed granular materials;effective surface area;permeametry apparatus;flow conductance;Carman-Kozeny equation;flow rate;given pressure drop;inherent assumptions;tunnel shapes;flow paths;wide distribution;aspect ratios;powdered systems;technological interest;commercial interest;microCT images;powdered material;Pore Network Model;Morse-Smale complex;approximate laminar fluid flow;pore structure;flow-permeable surface area;particle shapes","","","","46","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This topological segmentation is closely related to the theory of Lagrangian coherent structures and is based on a recently introduced quantity, the diffusion barrier strength (DBS). The DBS is defined similar to the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE), but incorporates diffusion during flow integration. Height ridges of the DBS indicate stochastic transport barriers and enhancers, i.e. material surfaces that are minimally or maximally diffusive. To apply these concepts to real-world data, we represent uncertainty in a flow by a stochastic differential equation that consists of a deterministic and a stochastic component modeled by a Gaussian. With this formulation we identify barriers and enhancers to stochastic transport, without performing expensive Monte Carlo simulation and with a computational complexity comparable to FTLE. In addition, we propose a complementary visualization to convey the absolute scale of uncertainties in the Lagrangian frame of reference. This enables us to study uncertainty in real-world datasets, for example due to small deviations, data reduction, or estimated from multiple ensemble runs.","","978-1-7281-8014-4","10.1109/VIS47514.2020.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331300","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Scientific visualization","Uncertainty;Monte Carlo methods;Satellite broadcasting;Measurement uncertainty;Stochastic processes;Data visualization;Probabilistic logic","computational complexity;computational fluid dynamics;data visualisation;differential equations;flow;Gaussian processes;Lyapunov methods;stochastic processes;topology","DBS;stochastic transport barriers;material surfaces;stochastic differential equation;stochastic component;FTLE;uncertain transport;unsteady flows;time-dependent flow dynamics;topological segmentation;Lagrangian coherent structures;diffusion barrier strength;finite-time Lyapunov exponent;flow integration;complementary visualization","","","","24","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although recently proposed learning-based methods demonstrate impressive registration performance on full shape observations, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when dealing with partial shapes. To bridge the performance gap between partial and full point set registration, we propose to incorporate a shape completion network to benefit the registration process. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable latent code for each pair of shapes, which can be regarded as the geometric encoding of the target shape. By doing so, our model does not require an explicit feature embedding network to learn the feature encodings. More importantly, both our shape completion and point set registration networks take the shared latent codes as input, which are optimized simultaneously with the parameters of two decoder networks in the training process. Therefore, the point set registration process can benefit from the joint optimization process of latent codes, which are enforced to represent the information of full shapes instead of partial ones. In the inference stage, we fix the network parameters and optimize the latent codes to obtain the optimal shape completion and registration results. Our proposed method is purely unsupervised and does not require ground truth supervision.

In this paper, we address this challenge by using foliation leaves to extract Reeb graphs. In particular, we employ a method for generating measured harmonic foliations by defining loops for foliation initialization and diffusing leaves from loops over the surface. We demonstrate that when the loops are determined, the neighboring relationships between the leaves from different loops are fixed. Thus, we can use loops to represent surface components for robustly detecting the interrelationships between surface components. As a result, we are able to extract stable and concise Reeb graphs. We developed novel measures for loop determination and improved foliation generation, and our method allows the user to manually prescribe loops for generating Reeb graphs with desired structures. Therefore, the potential of Reeb graphs for representing surfaces is enhanced, including conveniently representing the symmetries of the surface and ignoring topological noise.

While several techniques exist in the literature, they can only be applied to classical fluids. As quantum fluids with turbulence are gaining attention in physics, extracting and visualizing vortex-core lines for quantum fluids is increasingly desirable. In this article, we develop an efficient vortex-core line vectorization method for quantum fluids enabling real-time visualization of high-resolution quantum turbulence structure. From a dataset obtained through simulation, our technique first identifies vortex nodes based on the circulation field. To vectorize the vortex-core lines interpolating these vortex nodes, we propose a novel graph-based data structure, with iterative graph reduction and density-guided local optimization, to locate sub-grid-scale vortex-core line samples more precisely, which are then vectorized by continuous curves. This vortex-core representation naturally captures complex topology, such as branching during reconnection. Our vectorization approach reduces memory consumption by orders of magnitude, enabling real-time visualization performance. Different types of interactive visualizations are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of our technique, which could help further research on quantum turbulence.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.2981460","ShanghaiTech University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9039696","Quantum turbulence;vortex-core line vectorization;real-time visualization;graph representation","Mathematical model;Visualization;Real-time systems;Data visualization;Quantum mechanics;Quantum computing","data structures;data visualisation;flow visualisation;graph theory;interpolation;turbulence;vectors;vortices","interactive visualizations;quantum turbulence vortex-core lines;vectorizing vortex-core lines;high-quality visualization;classical fluids;quantum fluids;vortex-core line vectorization method;high-resolution quantum turbulence structure;vortex nodes;novel graph-based data structure;iterative graph reduction;density-guided local optimization;sub-grid-scale vortex-core line samples;vortex-core representation;vectorization approach;real-time visualization performance","","","","62","IEEE","17 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key problem with DBS is determining optimal parameters for clinical outcome. While multiple parameters may influence outcomes in DBS, we explore spatial correlation of volume of tissue activated (VTA) to Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores. Using the Neurostimulation Uncertainty Viewer (nuView), we investigate a number of cooperative visualizations for DBS inspection. Surface-to-surface Euclidean distance between VTA and selected brain nuclei are used in a linked 3D and parallel coordinates view of patient outcome. We then present a semivariogram-based approach to measure spatial correlation of patient outcomes with VTA. As a third component, nuView provides a unique visualization of an ensemble of electrode placements to reduce clutter and emphasize electrodes with spatially similar VTA.

For example, our experiments show how trajectory optimization can become increasingly ill-conditioned with longer trajectories, but parameterizing control as partial target statesâe.g., target angles converted to torques using a PD-controllerâcan act as an efficient preconditioner. Both our visualizations and quantitative empirical data also indicate that neural network policy optimization scales better than trajectory optimization for long planning horizons.

Encoding edge probability using visual variables like width or fuzziness makes it difficult for users of static network visualizations to estimate network statistics like densities, isolates, path lengths, or clustering under uncertainty. We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network realizations sampled from a network distribution defined by probabilistic edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability for uncertainty estimation. We present a community matching algorithm to enable visualizing the uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants' estimates fell, on average, within 11% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared to articulate the distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed. Based on these findings, we synthesize design recommendations for developing and using animated visualizations for probabilistic networks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114679","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1907941,IIS-1815760); Microsoft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552465","Network;Uncertainty;Application","Probabilistic logic;Visualization;Uncertainty;Layout;Task analysis;Stability analysis;Encoding","computer animation;data visualisation;graph theory;image representation;probability","probabilistic graphs;Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots;NetHOPs;traditional node-link diagram;encoding edge probability;visual variables;static network visualizations;network statistics;visualization technique;network realizations;network distribution;probabilistic edges;aggregation;anchoring algorithm;dynamic graph;longitudinal graph;uncertainty estimation;51 network experts;common visual analysis tasks;network structures;network analysts;animated visualizations;probabilistic networks","","","","93","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the procedure of manually creating such line art work can be quite tedious and time-consuming. In this paper, we present an interactive system that offers a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) scheme for producing hypnotic line art images by integrating and placing evenly-spaced streamlines in tensor fields. With an input picture segmented, the user just needs to sketch a few illustrative strokes to guide the construction of a tensor field for each part of the objects therein. Specifically, we propose a new method which controls, with great precision, the aesthetic layout and artistic drawing of an array of streamlines in each tensor field to emulate the style of hypnotic line art. Given several parameters for streamlines such as density, thickness, and sharpness, our system is capable of generating professional-level hypnotic line art work. With great ease of use, it allows art designers to explore a wide variety of possibilities to obtain hypnotic line art results of their own preferences.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3032734","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234714","Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR);hypnotic line art;tensor field design;streamline placement;vector field visualization","Art;Tensors;Three-dimensional displays;Streaming media;Shape;Rendering (computer graphics);Layout","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Rules of thumb grounded in perceptual science and visual arts generally form the basis of recommendation tools to support color assignment, but palette design is more nuanced than optimizing for perceptual tasks. In this work, we investigate how the general public reconciles the varied facets of color design in visualization. Does their decision-making align with established rules of thumb? What factors do they take into consideration? Through a crowd-sourced study with 63 participants, we find that the majority of palette choices are perceptually motivated, but other factors such as semantic associations and bias also play a role. We identify some flaws in participant reasoning, highlight clashes in opinions, and present some implications for future work in this space.","","978-1-6654-3335-8","10.1109/VIS49827.2021.9623314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623314","Color;General Public;Human Subjects Qualitative Studies","Fault diagnosis;Visualization;Image color analysis;Conferences;Decision making;Semantics;Data visualization","data visualisation;image colour analysis","visualization design;data interpretation;evoking emotions;perceptual science;visual arts;recommendation tools;color palette design;decision-making;crowd-sourced study;palette choices;Canada;people;color palette selection","","","","37","","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then use it to guide the generation of adversarial examples to evaluate models' spatial robustness and obtain actionable insights.

Automatic layout is a key requirement for effective visual display of such information. This paper introduces a new layout algorithm named fCoSE for compound graphs showing varying levels of groupings or abstractions with support for user-specified placement constraints. fCoSE builds on a previous compound spring embedder layout algorithm and makes use of the spectral graph drawing technique for producing a quick draft layout, followed by phases where constraints are enforced and compound structures are properly shown while polishing the layout with respect to commonly accepted graph layout criteria. Experimental evaluation verifies that fCoSE produces quality layouts and is fast enough for interactive applications with small to medium-sized graphs by combining the speed of spectral graph drawing technique with the quality of force-directed layout algorithms while satisfying specified constraints and properly displaying compound structures. An implementation of fCoSE along with documentation and a demo page is freely available on GitHub.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3095303","The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey(grant numbers:118E131,5180088); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9477202","Information visualization;graph layout;visual analytics;compound graphs;constrained layout;spectral graph drawing","Layout;Compounds;Stress;Data visualization;Time complexity;Springs;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we investigate how the AAR/AI process can scale up to support reinforcement learning (RL) agents that operate in complex environments. We augment the AAR/AI process to be performed at three levelsâepisode-level, decision-level, and explanation-levelâand integrate it into our redesigned visual analytics interface. We illustrate our approach through a usage scenario of analyzing why a RL agent lost in a complex real-time strategy game built with the StarCraft 2 engine.

It is also an increasingly popular means of presenting large scientific datasets to the general public in informal educational settings such as museums and planetaria. Visualization has appeared in many forms and in many cultures throughout digital history and contributes to the evolving visual language of science. Dr. Donna Cox and the Advanced Visualization Laboratory team at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois, collaborate with science teams, writers, producers, educators, and media distribution professionals on content designed to engage a wide range of audiences. In the past 8 years alone, her collaborative educational and outreach projects have produced science narratives featuring data visualizations that have been viewed by more than 45 million people worldwide. Cox leads an NSF-funded project to create scientific visualizations and then test audiences' understanding of the phenomenon that is being presented. Large-scale computational data present unique visualization challenges for producers of high-resolution, production-quality 3D IMAX movies; feature films; and museum fulldomes. In this keynote, Cox will provide a visual feast of major projects, including new digital fulldome museum shows and award-winning IMAX films.","","978-1-4673-9785-8","10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429482","","","computer aided instruction;data visualisation","data visualization;visual language;informal educational settings;Advanced Visualization Laboratory team;National Center for Supercomputing Applications;University of Illinois;production-quality 3D IMAX movies;feature films;museum fulldomes","","","","","","10 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
