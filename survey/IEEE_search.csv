"Hierarchical Edge Bundles: Visualization of Adjacency Relations in Hierarchical Data","D. Holten",Technische Univ. Eindhoven,"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","20 Nov 2006","2006","12","5","741","748","A compound graph is a frequently encountered type of data set. Relations are given between items, and a hierarchy is defined on the items as well. We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4015425","Network visualization;edge bundling;edge aggregation;edge concentration;curves;graph visualization;tree visualization;node-link diagrams;hierarchies;treemaps.","Data visualization;Tree graphs;Wires;Cables;Spline;Software systems;Social network services;Displays;Tree data structures","curve fitting;data visualisation;splines (mathematics);tree data structures;trees (mathematics)","hierarchical edge bundles;adjacency relation visualization;hierarchical data;compound graph;tree visualization method;B-spline curve;visual clutter","","566","18","33","IEEE","20 Nov 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Edgebreaker: connectivity compression for triangle meshes","J. Rossignac","Coll. of Comput., Georgia Inst. of Technol., Atlanta, GA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","6 Aug 2002","1999","5","1","47","61","Edgebreaker is a simple scheme for compressing the triangle/vertex incidence graphs (sometimes called connectivity or topology) of three-dimensional triangle meshes. Edgebreaker improves upon the storage required by previously reported schemes, most of which can guarantee only an O(t log(t)) storage cost for the incidence graph of a mesh of t triangles. Edgebreaker requires at most 2t bits for any mesh homeomorphic to a sphere and supports fully general meshes by using additional storage per handle and hole. For large meshes, entropy coding yields less than 1.5 bits per triangle. Edgebreaker's compression and decompression processes perform identical traversals of the mesh from one triangle to an adjacent one. At each stage, compression produces an op-code describing the topological relation between the current triangle and the boundary of the remaining part of the mesh. Decompression uses these op-codes to reconstruct the entire incidence graph. Because Edgebreaker's compression and decompression are independent of the vertex locations, they may be combined with a variety of vertex-compressing techniques that exploit topological information about the mesh to better estimate vertex locations. Edgebreaker may be used to compress the connectivity of an entire mesh bounding a 3D polyhedron or the connectivity of a triangulated surface patch whose boundary need not be encoded. The paper also offers a comparative survey of the rapidly growing field of geometric compression.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.764870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=764870","","Computer graphics;Solid modeling;Costs;Application software;Topology;Entropy coding;Computer architecture;Petroleum;Computational modeling;Analytical models","solid modelling;data compression;computational geometry;mesh generation;graph theory","Edgebreaker;connectivity compression;triangle meshes;triangle-vertex incidence graphs;topology;storage cost;entropy coding;geometric compression;decompression;vertex locations;vertex-compressing techniques;3D polyhedron;triangulated surface patch;3D models;solid modelling","","363","11","41","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376154","Network visualization;Matrix visualization;Hybrid visualization;Aggregation;Interaction.","Layout;Color;Animation;Matrix converters;Sparse matrices;Aggregates","data structures;data visualisation;matrix algebra;social sciences computing","NodeTrix visualization;social networks hybrid visualization;hardware capabilities;hybrid representation;adjacency matrices;interaction techniques;dragging selections;InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Models, Theoretical;Social Support;User-Computer Interface","306","5","35","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a ""video see through"" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. In this paper, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634325","Augmented reality;virtual visual servoing;robust estimators;real-time;model-based tracking;model-free tracking.","Augmented reality;Visual servoing;Robustness;Layout;Delay;Costs;Real time systems;Machine vision;Cameras;Robust control","computational geometry;image motion analysis;augmented reality;tracking;object detection;image sequences;least squares approximations","real-time markerless tracking;3D model-free augmented reality;virtual visual servoing framework;3D model-based tracking algorithm;monocular vision system;virtual objects;point-to-curves interaction matrices;3D geometrical primitives;M-estimator;visual control law;image sequences","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Systems;Feedback;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","305","14","55","","5 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on this formulation, a hybrid visualization is developed to disclose the multiple facets of each neuron and the interactions between them.

Our method uses a control mesh to guide the edge-clustering process; edge bundles can be formed by forcing all edges to pass through some control points on the mesh. The control mesh can be generated at different levels of detail either manually or automatically based on underlying graph patterns. Users can further interact with the edge-clustering results through several advanced visualization techniques such as color and opacity enhancement.

Lab., CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","7 Nov 2002","2002","8","3","239","254","We describe a general framework for out-of-core rendering and management of massive terrain surfaces. The two key components of this framework are: view-dependent refinement of the terrain mesh and a simple scheme for organizing the terrain data to improve coherence and reduce the number of paging events from external storage to main memory. Similar to several previously proposed methods for view-dependent refinement, we recursively subdivide a triangle mesh defined over regularly gridded data using longest-edge bisection. As part of this single, per-frame refinement pass, we perform triangle stripping, view frustum culling, and smooth blending of geometry using geomorphing. Meanwhile, our refinement framework supports a large class of error metrics, is highly competitive in terms of rendering performance, and is surprisingly simple to implement. Independent of our refinement algorithm, we also describe several data layout techniques for providing coherent access to the terrain data. By reordering the data in a manner that is more consistent with our recursive access pattern, we show that visualization of gigabyte-size data sets can be realized even on low-end, commodity PCs without the need for complicated and explicit data paging techniques. Rather, by virtue of dramatic improvements in multilevel cache coherence, we rely on the built-in paging mechanisms of the operating system to perform this task. The end result is a straightforward, simple-to-implement, pointerless indexing scheme that dramatically improves the data locality and paging performance over conventional matrix-based layouts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2002.1021577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1021577","","Data visualization;Geometry;Operating systems;Large-scale systems;Organizing;Personal communication networks;Indexing;Refining;Defense industry;Toy industry","data visualisation;rendering (computer graphics);computational geometry;cache storage;paged storage;operating systems (computers);quadtrees;geography","terrain simplification;view-dependent out-of-core visualization;out-of-core rendering;quadtree;massive terrain surfaces;terrain mesh refinement;paging events;longest-edge bisection;triangle stripping;view frustum culling;smooth blending;geometry;geomorphing;error metrics;data layout techniques;commodity personal computer;multilevel cache coherence;operating system;indexing","","165","8","35","","7 Nov 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike the previously proposed methods, our method can measure a radiance distribution of a real scene automatically and use it for superimposing virtual objects appropriately onto a real scene. First, a geometric model of the scene is constructed from a pair of omnidirectional images by using an omnidirectional stereo algorithm. Then, radiance of the scene is computed from a sequence of omnidirectional images taken with different shutter speeds and mapped onto the constructed geometric model. The radiance distribution mapped onto the geometric model is used for rendering virtual objects superimposed onto the scene image. As a result, even for a complex radiance distribution, our method can superimpose virtual objects with convincing shadings and shadows cast onto the real scene. We successfully tested the proposed method by using real images to show its effectiveness.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.764865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=764865","","Layout;Lighting;Augmented reality;Solid modeling;Stereo vision;Computer graphics;Computer vision;Geometry;Rendering (computer graphics);Testing","augmented reality;brightness;computational geometry;stereo image processing;image sequences;rendering (computer graphics)","radiance distribution;virtual objects;real scene;geometric model;omnidirectional images;omnidirectional stereo algorithm;image sequences;shutter speeds;rendering;shadows;computer vision;augmented reality","","142","18","19","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our approach, patches from a sample terrain (represented by a height field) are used to generate a new terrain. The synthesis is guided by a user-sketched feature map that specifies where terrain features occur in the resulting synthetic terrain. Our system emphasizes large-scale curvilinear features (ridges and valleys) because such features are the dominant visual elements in most terrains. Both the example height field and user's sketch map are analyzed using a technique from the field of geomorphology. The system finds patches from the example data that match the features found in the user's sketch. Patches are joined together using graph cuts and Poisson editing. The order in which patches are placed in the synthesized terrain is determined by breadth-first traversal of a feature tree and this generates improved results over standard raster-scan placement orders. Our technique supports user-controlled terrain synthesis in a wide variety of styles, based upon the visual richness of real-world terrain data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.1027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293025","Terrain synthesis;Digital Elevation Models;terrain analysis;texture synthesis.","Digital elevation models;Geology;Large-scale systems;Application software;Computational modeling;Aerospace simulation;Computer simulation;Fractals;Sun;Tree graphs","computer graphics;geomorphology;graph theory;terrain mapping;tree searching","terrain synthesis;digital elevation model;example-based system;user-sketched feature map;synthetic terrain;large-scale curvilinear features;geomorphology;graph cuts;Poisson editing;breadth-first traversal;raster-scan placement orders;texture synthesis","Algorithms;Altitude;Computer Graphics;Environment;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval","128","1","37","","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to the traditional approaches of precomputing a fixed number of level-of-detail representations for a given object, our approach involves statically generating a continuous level-of-detail representation for the object. This representation is then used at run time to guide the selection of appropriate triangles for display. The list of displayed triangles is updated incrementally from one frame to the next. Our approach is more effective than the current level-of-detail-based rendering approaches for most scientific visualization applications, where there are a limited number of highly complex objects that stay relatively close to the viewer.

Furthermore, users accessing large graph databases through an online connection or users running on less powerful (mobile) hardware simply do not have the resources needed to compute these overviews. In this paper, we advocate an interaction model that allows users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific node of interest.

This results in exploration that is largely opportunistic. Our contributions are techniques to help structural analysts understand social networks more effectively. We present SocialAction, a system that uses attribute ranking and coordinated views to help users systematically examine numerous SNA measures. Users can (1) flexibly iterate through visualizations of measures to gain an overview, filter nodes, and find outliers, (2) aggregate networks using link structure, find cohesive subgroups, and focus on communities of interest, and (3) untangle networks by viewing different link types separately, or find patterns across different link types using a matrix overview. For each operation, a stable node layout is maintained in the network visualization so users can make comparisons.

Mobility data sets characterize the variation of the presence of people in different places over time as well as movements (or flows) of people between the places. The analysis of mobility data is challenging due to the need to analyze and compare spatial situations (i.e., presence and flows of people at certain time moments) and to gain an understanding of the spatio-temporal changes (variations of situations over time). Traditional flow visualizations usually fail due to massive clutter. Modern approaches offer limited support for investigating the complex variation of the movements over longer time periods. We propose a visual analytics methodology that solves these issues by combined spatial and temporal simplifications. We have developed a graph-based method, called MobilityGraphs, which reveals movement patterns that were occluded in flow maps. Our method enables the visual representation of the spatio-temporal variation of movements for long time series of spatial situations originally containing a large number of intersecting flows. The interactive system supports data exploration from various perspectives and at various levels of detail by interactive setting of clustering parameters. The feasibility our approach was tested on aggregated mobility data derived from a set of geolocated Twitter posts within the Greater London city area and mobile phone call data records in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

To address massive overplotting of edges in huge graphs, we employ a splatting approach that transforms the edges to a pixel-based scalar field. This field represents the edge densities in a scalable way and is depicted by non-linear color mapping.

The incremental nature of the data implies that visualizations have to necessarily change their content and still provide comprehensible representations. In particular, in this paper we deal with the need to keep an eye on recent events together with providing a context on the past and to make relevant patterns accessible at any scale. Our technique adapts to the incoming data by taking care of the rate at which data items occur and by using a decay function to let the items fade away according to their relevance. Since access to details is also important, we also provide a novel distortion magnifying lens technique which takes into account the distortions introduced by the logarithmic time scale to augment readability in selected areas of interest.

To support interactive, multiscale visual analytics, a graph partitioning algorithm is applied to create region-level graphs which have smaller size than the original street-level graph. Graph centralities, including Pagerank and betweenness, are computed to characterize the time-varying importance of different urban regions. The centralities are visualized by three coordinated views including a node-link graph view, a map view and a temporal information view. Users can interactively examine the importance of streets to discover and assess city traffic patterns. We have implemented a fully working prototype of this approach and evaluated it using massive taxi trajectories of Shenzhen, China. TrajGraph's capability in revealing the importance of city streets was evaluated by comparing the calculated centralities with the subjective evaluations from a group of drivers in Shenzhen.

We guarantee the resulting surface representation to be closed and oriented, defined by a valid triangulation of the surface of the body, which in turn is presented as a collection of tetrahedra. The entire surface is ""wrapped"" by a collection of triangles, which form a graph structure, and where each triangle is contained within a single tetrahedron. The representation is similar to the homology theory that uses simplices embedded in a manifold to define a closed curve within each tetrahedron. We introduce data structures based upon a new encoding of the tetrahedra that are at least four times more compact than the standard data structures using vertices and triangles. For parallel computing and improved cache performance, the vertex information is stored local to the tetrahedra. We can distribute the vertices in such a way that no tetrahedron ever contains more than one vertex, We give methods to evaluate surface curvatures and principal directions at each vertex, whenever these quantities are defined. Finally, we outline a method for simplifying the surface, that is reducing the vertex count while preserving the geometry.

Our goal is to enable normally inanimate graphics objects, such as teapots and tables, to become animated, and learn to move about in a charming, cartoon like manner. To achieve this goal, we implement a system that can transform a wide class of objects into dynamic characters. Our formulation is based on parameterized hierarchical FFDs augmented with Lagrangian dynamics, and provides an efficient way to animate and control the simulated characters. Objects are assigned mass distributions and elastic deformation properties, which allow them to translate, rotate, and deform according to internal and external forces. In addition, we implement an automated optimization process that searches for suitable control strategies. The primary contributions of the work are threefold. First, we formulate a dynamic generalization of conventional, geometric FFDs. The formulation employs deformation modes which are tailored by the user and are expressed in terms of FFDs. Second, the formulation accommodates a hierarchy of dynamic FFDs that can be used to model local as well as global deformations. Third, the deformation modes can be active, thereby producing locomotion.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.620488","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=620488","","Animation;Deformable models;Automatic control;Lattices;Electrical capacitance tomography;Lagrangian functions;Computer graphics;Solid modeling;Shape control;Layout","computer animation;computational geometry;digital simulation;elastic deformation","dynamic free form deformations;animation synthesis;keyframe animation;Lagrangian dynamics;normally inanimate graphics objects;dynamic characters;parameterized hierarchical FFDs;simulated characters;mass distributions;elastic deformation properties;automated optimization process;control strategies;dynamic generalization;deformation modes;dynamic FFDs;global deformations;locomotion","","97","6","27","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While evidence exists that narrative sequencing in traditional stories can affect comprehension and memory, little is known about how sequencing choices affect narrative visualization. We consider the forms and reactions to sequencing in narrative visualization presentations to provide a deeper understanding with a focus on linear, 'slideshow-style' presentations. We conduct a qualitative analysis of 42 professional narrative visualizations to gain empirical knowledge on the forms that structure and sequence take. Based on the results of this study we propose a graph-driven approach for automatically identifying effective sequences in a set of visualizations to be presented linearly. Our approach identifies possible transitions in a visualization set and prioritizes local (visualization-to-visualization) transitions based on an objective function that minimizes the cost of transitions from the audience perspective. We conduct two studies to validate this function. We also expand the approach with additional knowledge of user preferences for different types of local transitions and the effects of global sequencing strategies on memory, preference, and comprehension. Our results include a relative ranking of types of visualization transitions by the audience perspective and support for memory and subjective rating benefits of visualization sequences that use parallelism as a structural device. We discuss how these insights can guide the design of narrative visualization and systems that support optimization of visualization sequence.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634182","Data visualization;Sequential analysis;Parallel processing;Encoding;Linear programming;narrative structure;Data storytelling;narrative visualization","Data visualization;Sequential analysis;Parallel processing;Encoding;Linear programming","cognition;data visualisation;graph theory;humanities;sequences","narrative sequencing;slideshow-style presentations;qualitative analysis;professional narrative visualizations;graph-driven approach;automatic effective sequence identification;visualization set;local transitions;visualization-to-visualization transitions;audience perspective;user preferences;global sequencing strategies;visualization sequence optimization;narrative systems","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Comprehension;Computer Graphics;Humans;Multimodal Imaging;Narration;Pattern Recognition, Visual;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface;Visual Perception","93","","37","IEEE","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While currently ignored by most visualization models, this translation entails a loss of information and the introduction of a number of artifacts that can be useful, (e.g., aggregation, structures) or distracting (e.g., over-plotting, clutter) for the analysis. This phenomenon is observed in parallel coordinates, where overlapping lines between adjacent axes form distinct patterns, representing the relation between variables they connect. However, even for a small number of dimensions, the challenge is to effectively convey the relationships for all combinations of dimensions. The size of the dataset and a large number of dimensions only add to the complexity of this problem. To address these issues, we propose Pargnostics, parallel coordinates diagnostics, a model based on screen-space metrics that quantify the different visual structures. Pargnostics metrics are calculated for pairs of axes and take into account the resolution of the display as well as potential axis inversions. Metrics include the number of line crossings, crossing angles, convergence, overplotting, etc. To construct a visualization view, the user can pick from a ranked display showing pairs of coordinate axes and the structures between them, or examine all possible combinations of axes at once in a matrix display. Picking the best axes layout is an NP-complete problem in general, but we provide a way of automatically optimizing the display according to the user's preferences based on our metrics and model.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613439","Parallel Coordinates;metrics;display optimization;visualization models.","Measurement;Data visualization;Histograms;Clutter;Optimization;Visualization;Pixel","computational complexity;data visualisation;interactive programming;matrix algebra;parallel programming;program diagnostics","pargnostics;screen-space metrics;interactive visualization;screen space;parallel coordinates diagnostics;matrix display;NP-complete problem","","88","","32","","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These laser scanner systems, however, yield an enormous amount of irregular and scattered digitized point data that requires intensive reconstruction processing. Reconstruction of freeform objects consists of two main stages: parameterization and surface fitting. Selection of an appropriate parameterization is essential for topology reconstruction as well as surface fitness. Current parameterization methods have topological problems that lead to undesired surface fitting results, such as noisy self-intersecting surfaces. Such problems are particularly common with concave shapes whose parametric grid is self-intersecting, resulting in a fitted surface that considerably twists and changes its original shape. In such cases, other parameterization approaches should be used in order to guarantee non-self-intersecting behavior. The parameterization method described in this paper is based on two stages: 2D initial parameterization; and 3D adaptive parameterization. Two methods were developed for the first stage: partial differential equation (PDE) parameterization and neural network self organizing maps (SOM) parameterization. The Gradient Descent Algorithm (GDA) and Random Surface Error Correction (RSEC), both of which are iterative surface fitting methods, were developed and implemented.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.910817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=910817","","Scattering parameters;Surface fitting;Surface reconstruction;Shape;Reverse engineering;Topology;Noise shaping;Partial differential equations;Neural networks;Self organizing feature maps","image reconstruction;surface fitting;partial differential equations;self-organising feature maps;iterative methods;solid modelling;computational geometry","2D initial parameterization;3D scattered points;neural network;freeform object reconstruction;surface fitting;topology reconstruction;noisy self-intersecting surfaces;3D adaptive parameterization;partial differential equation parameterization;self organizing maps;Gradient Descent Algorithm;Random Surface Error Correction;iterative methods;solid modeling","","87","2","24","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is a challenging problem in network visualization to automatically draw appealing metro maps. There are two aspects to this problem that depend on each other: the layout problem of finding station and link coordinates and the labeling problem of placing nonoverlapping station labels. In this paper, we present a new integral approach that solves the combined layout and labeling problem (each of which, independently, is known to be NP-hard) using mixed-integer programming (MIP). We identify seven design rules used in most real-world metro maps. We split these rules into hard and soft constraints and translate them into an MIP model. Our MIP formulation finds a metro map that satisfies all hard constraints (if such a drawing exists) and minimizes a weighted sum of costs that correspond to the soft constraints. We have implemented the MIP model and present a case study and the results of an expert assessment to evaluate the performance of our approach in comparison to both manually designed official maps and results of previous layout methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.81","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473229","Network visualization;graph drawing;graph labeling;metro map;octilinear layout;mixed-integer programming.","Labeling;Navigation;Visualization;Network topology;Costs;Urban areas;Geography;Space stations;Information geometry","cartography;computational complexity;data visualisation;integer programming","high quality metro maps drawing;high quality metro maps labeling;mixed integer programming;public transport networks;visual aids;route planning;navigation tasks;network visualization;NP hard","","86","1","39","IEEE","27 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Eye tracking was used to identify visual exploration behaviors of participants that were asked to solve a typical hierarchy exploration task by inspecting a static tree diagram: finding the least common ancestor of a given set of marked leaf nodes. To uncover exploration strategies, we examined fixation points, duration, and saccades of participants' gaze trajectories. For the non-radial diagrams, we additionally investigated the effect of diagram orientation by switching the position of the root node to each of the four main orientations. We also recorded and analyzed correctness of answers as well as completion times in addition to the eye movement data. We found out that traditional and orthogonal tree layouts significantly outperform radial tree layouts for the given task. Furthermore, by applying trajectory analysis techniques we uncovered that participants cross-checked their task solution more often in the radial than in the non-radial layouts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.193","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065011","Hierarchy visualization;node-link layout;eye tracking;user study.","Data visualization;Tracking;Trajectory;Hierarchical systems;Upper bound;Analysis of variance","data visualisation;diagrams;trees (mathematics)","orthogonal diagrams;radial tree diagrams;eye tracking study;node-link diagrams;parent-child relationship;eye tracking experiment;radial node-link tree layouts;visual exploration behavior;hierarchy exploration task;static tree diagram;gaze trajectory;nonradial diagrams;diagram orientation;eye movement data;orthogonal tree layout;trajectory analysis;nonradial layout","Adult;Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Eye Movement Measurements;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;User-Computer Interface;Visual Perception;Young Adult","83","","24","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One or more sources are connected to several targets by lines whose thickness corresponds to the amount of flow between a source and a target. Good flow maps reduce visual clutter by merging (bundling) lines smoothly and by avoiding self-intersections. Most flow maps are still drawn by hand and only few automated methods exist. Some of the known algorithms do not support edge-bundling and those that do, cannot guarantee crossing-free flows. We present a new algorithmic method that uses edge-bundling and computes crossing-free flows of high visual quality. Our method is based on so-called spiral trees, a novel type of Steiner tree which uses logarithmic spirals. Spiral trees naturally induce a clustering on the targets and smoothly bundle lines. Our flows can also avoid obstacles, such as map features, region outlines, or even the targets.

"Modeling, animating, and rendering complex scenes using volumetric textures","F.

The amount of data, the tediousness of modeling and animation tasks, and the cost of realistic rendering have caused such kind of scene to see only limited use even in high-end productions. The author describes how the use of volumetric textures is well suited to such scenes. These primitives can greatly simplify modeling and animation tasks. More importantly, they can be very efficiently rendered using ray tracing with few aliasing artifacts. The main idea, initially introduced by Kajiya and Kay (1989), is to represent a pattern of 3D geometry in a reference volume, that is tiled over an underlying surface much like a regular 2D texture. In our contribution, the mapping is independent of the mesh subdivision, the pattern can contain any kind of shape, and it is prefiltered at different scales as for MIP-mapping. Although the model encoding is volumetric, the rendering method differs greatly from traditional volume rendering. A volumetric texture only exists in the neighborhood of a surface, and the repeated instances (called texels) of the reference volume are spatially deformed. Furthermore, each voxel of the reference volume contains a key feature which controls the reflectance function that represents aggregate intravoxel geometry. This allows for ray tracing of highly complex scenes with very few aliasing artifacts, using a single ray per pixel (for the part of the scene using the volumetric texture representation). The major technical considerations of our method lie in the ray-path determination and in the specification of the reflectance function.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.675652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=675652","","Animation;Layout;Ray tracing;Geometry;Surface texture;Reflectivity;Hair;Costs;Production;Shape","computer animation;rendering (computer graphics);image texture;realistic images;ray tracing;computational geometry","modeling;animation;rendering;complex scenes;volumetric textures;complex repetitive scenes;realistic rendering;ray tracing;aliasing;3D geometry;mesh subdivision;volume rendering;reflectance function;aggregate intravoxel geometry;three dimensional geometry","","78","16","28","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is often difficult for users to understand and evaluate multidimensional clustering results, especially the quality of clusters and their semantics. For large and complex data, high-level statistical information about the clusters is often needed for users to evaluate cluster quality while a detailed display of multidimensional attributes of the data is necessary to understand the meaning of clusters. In this paper, we introduce DICON, an icon-based cluster visualization that embeds statistical information into a multi-attribute display to facilitate cluster interpretation, evaluation, and comparison. We design a treemap-like icon to represent a multidimensional cluster, and the quality of the cluster can be conveniently evaluated with the embedded statistical information. We further develop a novel layout algorithm which can generate similar icons for similar clusters, making comparisons of clusters easier. User interaction and clutter reduction are integrated into the system to help users more effectively analyze and refine clustering results for large datasets. We demonstrate the power of DICON through a user study and a case study in the healthcare domain.

In an iterative process, such biologists observe the reactions of living cells under various experimental conditions, view the results in the context of the interaction graph, and then propose changes to the graph model. These graphs serve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incorporates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaborators we conclude that Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658137","Index Terms—;Graph layout;systems biology visualization;small multiples;design study","Visualization;Biological system modeling;Biological systems;Context modeling;Immune system;Collaborative tools;Displays;Performance analysis;Data analysis;Cells (biology)","biology computing;data visualisation;decision theory;graph theory;iterative methods;knowledge representation","multiple experimental condition visualization;interaction graph layout;biological system;iterative process;living cells reaction observation;dynamic knowledge representation;drawing package;data information display;design decision;cerebral tool","Biology;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Models, Biological;Proteome;Signal Transduction;Software;User-Computer Interface","73","","42","","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the GPU requires a data parallel programming model, the challenge is devising a mapping of a naturally unstructured graph into a well-partitioned structured one. This is done by computing a balanced partitioning of a general graph. This algorithm provides a general multi-level scheme, which has the potential to be used not only for computation on the GPU, but also on emerging multi-core architectures.

In our method, guides to searching for cells intersected by an isosurface are generated as a pre-process. These guides are two kinds of cell lists: an extrema graph, and sorted lists of boundary cells. In an extrema graph, extremum points are connected by arcs, and each arc has a list of cells through which it passes. At the same time, all boundary cells are sorted according to their minimum and maximum values, and two sorted lists are then generated. Isosurfaces are generated by visiting adjacent intersected cells in order. Here, the starting cells for this process are found by searching in an extrema graph and in sorted boundary cell lists. In this process, isosurfaces appear to propagate themselves. Our algorithm is efficient, since it visits only cells that are intersected by an isosurface and cells whose IDs are included in the guides. It is especially efficient when many isosurfaces are interactively generated in a huge volume.

First, we demonstrate how features identified by thresholding isosurfaces can be defined in terms of the Morse complex. Second, we present a specialized hierarchy that encodes the feature segmentation independent of the threshold while still providing a flexible multiresolution representation. Third, for a given parameter selection, we create detailed tracking graphs representing the complete evolution of all features in a combustion simulation over several hundred time steps. Finally, we discuss a user interface that correlates the tracking information with interactive rendering of the segmented isosurfaces enabling an in-depth analysis of the temporal behavior. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing three numerical simulations of lean hydrogen flames subject to different levels of turbulence. Due to their unstable nature, lean flames burn in cells separated by locally extinguished regions. The number, area, and evolution over time of these cells provide important insights into the impact of turbulence on the combustion process. Utilizing the hierarchy, we can perform an extensive parameter study without reprocessing the data for each set of parameters. The resulting statistics enable scientists to select appropriate parameters and provide insight into the sensitivity of the results with respect to the choice of parameters. Our method allows for the first time to quantitatively correlate the turbulence of the burning process with the distribution of burning regions, properly segmented and selected. In particular, our analysis shows that counterintuitively stronger turbulence leads to larger cell structures, which burn more intensely than expected. This behavior suggests that flames could be stabilized under much leaner conditions than previously anticipated.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.69","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5128904","Visualization;data analysis;topological data analysis;Morse complex;Reeb graph;feature detection;feature tracking;combustion simulations;burning regions.","Hydrogen;Fires;Isosurfaces;Combustion;Robustness;User interfaces;Computer graphics;Information analysis;Numerical simulation;Statistical distributions","combustion;feature extraction;flames;graph theory;graphical user interfaces;image representation;image resolution;image segmentation;interactive systems;numerical analysis;rendering (computer graphics)","burning structures;lean premixed hydrogen flames;topology;isosurfaces;Morse complex;feature segmentation;flexible multiresolution representation;tracking graphs;user interface;interactive rendering;numerical simulations;combustion process","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Fires;Hot Temperature;Hydrogen;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Chemical;Rheology;User-Computer Interface","71","","37","","26 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While topological data analysis has gained in popularity over the last two decades, it has not yet been widely adopted as a standard data analysis tool for end users or developers. TTK aims at addressing this problem by providing a unified, generic, efficient, and robust implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK/C++) for fast prototyping or through direct, dependency-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems. While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings and extensions.

A mesh model may alternatively be provided, in which case a height field is first created via orthogonal or perspective projection. The height field is regularly gridded and treated as an image, enabling a modified AHE method to be used to generate a bas-relief with a user-chosen height range. We modify the original image-contrast-enhancement AHE method to use gradient weights also to enhance the shape features of the bas-relief. To effectively compress the height field, we limit the height-dependent scaling factors used to compute relative height variations in the output from height variations in the input; this prevents any height differences from having too great effect. Results of AHE over different neighborhood sizes are averaged to preserve information at different scales in the resulting bas-relief. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed algorithm is simple and yet largely preserves original shape features. Experiments show that our results are, in general, comparable to and in some cases better than the best previously published methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760139","Bas-relief;adaptive histogram equalization;feature enhancement.","Histograms;Adaptive equalizers;Image coding;Shape;Production;Costs;Sun;Mesh generation;Layout;Automation","computational geometry;image enhancement;mesh generation","bas-relief generation;adaptive histogram equalization;input height field;mesh model;image contrast enhancement AHE method;gradient weights;shape features;height dependent scaling factor","","61","","27","","23 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Evolutionary patterns of ego-networks along time provide huge insights to many domains such as sociology, anthropology, and psychology. However, the analysis of dynamic ego-networks remains challenging due to its complicated time-varying graph structures, for example: alters come and leave, ties grow stronger and fade away, and alter communities merge and split. Most of the existing dynamic graph visualization techniques mainly focus on topological changes of the entire network, which is not adequate for egocentric analytical tasks. In this paper, we present egoSlider, a visual analysis system for exploring and comparing dynamic ego-networks. egoSlider provides a holistic picture of the data through multiple interactively coordinated views, revealing ego-network evolutionary patterns at three different layers: a macroscopic level for summarizing the entire ego-network data, a mesoscopic level for overviewing specific individuals' ego-network evolutions, and a microscopic level for displaying detailed temporal information of egos and their alters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of egoSlider with a usage scenario with the DBLP publication records.

Implicitly, their goal is to create visual representations that are more intuitive to human observers. In this paper, we asked users to explicitly manipulate nodes in a network diagram to create layouts that they felt best captured the relationships in the data. This allowed us to measure organizational behavior directly, allowing us to evaluate the perceptual importance of particular visual features, such as edge crossings and edge-lengths uniformity. We also manipulated the interior structure of the node relationships by designing data sets that contained clusters, that is, sets of nodes that are strongly interconnected. By varying the degree to which these clusters were “masked” by extraneous edges we were able to measure observers’ sensitivity to the existence of clusters and how they revealed them in the network diagram. Based on these measurements we found that observers are able to recover cluster structure, that the distance between clusters is inversely related to the strength of the clustering, and that users exhibit the tendency to use edges to visually delineate perceptual groups. These results demonstrate the role of perceptual organization in representing graph data and provide concrete recommendations for graph layout algorithms.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658147","Index Terms—;Network layout visualization;perceptual organization;graph layout;user studies","Humans;Clustering algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Particle measurements;Concrete;Data visualization;Neural networks;Communication networks;Social network services;Performance analysis","data visualisation;graph theory","perceptual organization;user-generated graph layouts;visual representations;edge crossings;edge-lengths uniformity;network layout visualization","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;User-Computer Interface;Visual Perception","57","1","22","IEEE","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Time-variant flow data pose two difficult challenges for visualization and analysis. First, flows may connect arbitrary locations (not only neighbors), thus making a graph with numerous edge intersections, which is hard to visualize in a comprehensible way. Even a single spatial situation consisting of flows in one time step is hard to explore. The second challenge is the need to analyze long time series consisting of numerous spatial situations. We present an approach facilitating exploration of long-term flow data by means of spatial and temporal abstraction. It involves a special way of data aggregation, which allows representing spatial situations by diagram maps instead of flow maps, thus reducing the intersections and occlusions pertaining to flow maps. The aggregated data are used for clustering of time intervals by similarity of the spatial situations. Temporal and spatial displays of the clustering results facilitate the discovery of periodic patterns and longer-term trends in the mass mobility behavior.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2016.2616404","VaVeL(grant numbers:688380); SoBigData(grant numbers:654024); BigData4ATM(grant numbers:699260); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7587808","Movement data;mobility behavior;spatial flow situation;flow map","Time series analysis;Market research;Data visualization;Complexity theory;Electronic mail;Visualization;Clutter","data aggregation;data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;pattern clustering;time series","mass mobility;spatial abstraction;temporal abstraction;origin-destination movement data;OD movement data;spatio-temporal patterns;time-variant flow data;data visualization;data analysis;graph;time series;data aggregation;diagram maps;flow maps;clustering;periodic pattern discovery","","57","","56","IEEE","11 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce a procedure called ""loop surgery"" that transforms M into a mesh M' by a sequence of cuts and guarantees the Reeb graph of f(M') to be loop free. Therefore, loop surgery reduces Reeb graph computation to the simpler problem of computing a contour tree, for which well-known algorithms exist that are theoretically efficient (O(n log n)) and fast in practice. Inverse cuts reconstruct the loops removed at the beginning.The time complexity of our algorithm is that of a contour tree computation plus a loop surgery overhead, which depends on the number of handles of the mesh. Our systematic experiments confirm that for real-life data, this overhead is comparable to the computation of the contour tree, demonstrating virtually linear scalability on meshes ranging from 70 thousand to 3.5 million tetrahedra. Performance numbers show that our algorithm, although restricted to volumetric data, has an average speedup factor of 6,500 over the previous fastest techniques, handling larger and more complex data-sets.We demonstrate the verstility of our approach by extending fast topologically clean isosurface extraction to non simply-connected domains. We apply this technique in the context of pressure analysis for mechanical design. In this case, our technique produces results in matter of seconds even for the largest meshes. For the same models, previous Reeb graph techniques do not produce a result.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290727","Reeb graph;scalar field topology;isosurfaces;topological simplification","Surgery;Tree graphs;Data visualization;Isosurfaces;Data mining;Topology;Algorithm design and analysis;Stress;Scalability;Level set","computational complexity;data visualisation;graph theory;mesh generation","loop surgery;volumetric meshes;Reeb graphs;contour trees;scalar function;time complexity;mechanical design pressure analysis","","54","","29","IEEE","23 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multiscale pan-and-zoom systems are effective because they directly support this approach. However, generating abstract overviews of large data sets is difficult and most systems take advantage of only one type of abstraction: visual abstraction. Furthermore, these existing systems limit the analyst to a single zooming path on their data and thus to a single set of abstract views. This paper presents: 1) a formalism for describing multiscale visualizations of data cubes with both data and visual abstraction and 2) a method for independently zooming along one or more dimensions by traversing a zoom graph with nodes at different levels of detail. As an example of how to design multiscale visualizations using our system, we describe four design patterns using our formalism.

The registration of these two scans is desirable so that the user can clarify situations or confirm polyp findings at a location in one scan with the same location in the other, thereby improving polyp detection rates and reducing false positives. However, this supine-prone registration is challenging because of the substantial distortions in the colon shape due to the patient's change in position. We present an efficient algorithm and framework for performing this registration through the use of conformal geometry to guarantee that the registration is a diffeomorphism (a one-to-one and onto mapping). The taeniae coli and colon flexures are automatically extracted for each supine and prone surface, employing the colon geometry. The two colon surfaces are then divided into several segments using the flexures, and each segment is cut along a taenia coli and conformally flattened to the rectangular domain using holomorphic differentials. The mean curvature is color encoded as texture images, from which feature points are automatically detected using graph cut segmentation, mathematic morphological operations, and principal component analysis. Corresponding feature points are found between supine and prone and are used to adjust the conformal flattening to be quasi-conformal, such that the features become aligned. We present multiple methods of visualizing our results, including 2D flattened rendering, corresponding 3D endoluminal views, and rendering of distortion measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of our registration method by illustrating matched views on both the 2D flattened colon images and in the 3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the correctness of the results by measuring the distance between features on the registered colons.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613475","Data registration;geometry-based techniques;medical visualization;mathematical foundations for visualization.","Colon;Conformal mapping;Feature extraction;Surface morphology;Visualization;Three dimensional displays;Harmonic analysis","computerised tomography;conformal mapping;graph theory;image registration;image segmentation;image texture;medical image processing;principal component analysis;rendering (computer graphics)","supine colon registration;prone colon registration;quasiconformal mapping;virtual colonoscopy;CT scans;polyp findings;polyp detection rates;supine-prone registration;substantial distortions;colon shape;conformal geometry;diffeomorphism;taeniae coli;colon flexures;colon geometry;colon surfaces;rectangular domain;holomorphic differentials;mean curvature;texture images;graph cut segmentation;mathematic morphological operations;principal component analysis;conformal flattening;2D flattened rendering;3D endoluminal views;distortion measurements;registration method;2D flattened colon images;3D volume rendered colon endoluminal view","Algorithms;Colon;Colonography, Computed Tomographic;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Anatomic;Prone Position;Supine Position","54","1","39","IEEE","28 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we describe Vectorized Radviz (VRV) which extends the number of dimensions through data flattening. We show how VRV increases the power of Radviz through these extra dimensions by enhancing the flexibility in the layout of the DAs. We apply VRV to the problem of analyzing the results of multiple clusterings of the same data set, called multiple cluster sets or cluster ensembles. We show how features of VRV help discern patterns across the multiple cluster sets.

Traditional geometry-based methods tend to receive undesirable results due to the complex appearance of human teeth (e.g., missing/rotten teeth, feature-less regions, crowding teeth, extra medical attachments, etc.). Furthermore, labeling of individual tooth is hardly enabled in traditional tooth segmentation methods. To address these issues, we propose to learn a generic and robust segmentation model by exploiting deep Neural Networks, namely NNs. The segmentation task is achieved by labeling each mesh face. We extract a set of geometry features as face feature representations. In the training step, the network is fed with those features, and produces a probability vector, of which each element indicates the probability a face belonging to the corresponding model part. To this end, we extensively experiment with various network structures, and eventually arrive at a 2-level hierarchical CNNs structure for tooth segmentation: one for teeth-gingiva labeling and the other for inter-teeth labeling. Further, we propose a novel boundary-aware tooth simplification method to significantly improve efficiency in the stage of feature extraction. After CNNs prediction, we do graph-based label optimization and further refine the boundary with an improved version of fuzzy clustering. The accuracy of our mesh labeling method exceeds that of the state-of-art geometry-based methods, reaching 99.06 percent measured by area which is directly applicable in orthodontic CAD systems. It is also robust to any possible foreign matters on model surface, e.g., air bubbles, dental accessories, and many more.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2839685","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502306); China Young 1000 Talents Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362667","Boundary-aware simplification;3D mesh segmentation;deep convolutional neural networks;fuzzy clustering","Teeth;Dentistry;Feature extraction;Labeling;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Image segmentation","CAD;convolutional neural nets;dentistry;feature extraction;geometry;graph theory;image representation;image segmentation;medical image processing;optimisation;pattern clustering;probability","deep convolutional neural networks;3D dental model segmentation;human teeth;feature-less regions;generic segmentation model;robust segmentation model;segmentation task;mesh face;geometry features;face feature representations;network structures;2-level hierarchical CNNs structure;teeth-gingiva labeling;inter-teeth labeling;feature extraction;mesh labeling method;geometry-based methods;3D tooth segmentation methods;probability vector;boundary-aware tooth simplification method;graph-based label optimization;fuzzy clustering;orthodontic CAD systems","Algorithms;Dentition;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Neural Networks, Computer;Radiography, Dental;Tomography, X-Ray Computed;Tooth","53","","80","IEEE","22 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present two taxonomies of visualizations of dynamic graphs: one of non-hybrid techniques, and one of hybrid techniques. We also describe a prototype, called DiffAni, that allows a graph to be visualized as a sequence of three kinds of tiles: diff tiles that show difference maps over some time interval, animation tiles that show the evolution of the graph over some time interval, and small multiple tiles that show the graph state at an individual time slice. This sequence of tiles is ordered by time and covers all time slices in the data. An experimental evaluation of DiffAni shows that our hybrid approach has advantages over non-hybrid techniques in certain cases.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634116","Animation;Computer graphics;Prototypes;difference map;Dynamic networks;hybrid visualization;taxonomy;evolution;animation","Animation;Computer graphics;Prototypes","computer animation;data visualisation;graph theory","DiffAni;dynamic graph;difference maps;animation;hybrid visualization;diff tiles","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Information Storage and Retrieval;Software;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface;Video Recording","53","2","43","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using features in the data as well as Gestalt principles in the visualization such as closure, proximity, and similarity, we developed node reordering strategies for the msv to make these features stand out that optionally take the hierarchical node structure into account. This enables users to find temporal properties such as trends, counter trends, periodicity, temporal shifts, and anomalies in the network as well as structural properties such as communities and stars. We introduce the circular msv that further reduces visual clutter. In addition, the (circular) msv is extended to also convey time-series data associated with the nodes.

It allows for the articulation of compound marks or glyphs as well as links between these glyphs, all without requiring any coding or knowledge of constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, thanks to the constraint-based layout approach, Charticulator can export chart designs into reusable templates that can be imported into other visualization tools.

In addition, we label the names of stations that are on the route of a passenger according to human preferences, occlusions, and consistencies of label positions using the graph cuts method. Our system achieves real-time performance by being able to report instant information because of the carefully designed energy terms. We apply our method to layout a number of metro maps and show the results and timing statistics to demonstrate the feasibility of our technique.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065020","Focus+context visualization;metro map;octilinear layout;graph labeling;optimization.","Layout;Graphics;Optimization;Nonlinear distortion","cartography;graph theory;mobile handsets;railways","focus+context metro maps;metro map visualization;modern city;mobile devices;octilinear transportation lines;regular station distances;energy terms;graph cuts method;train arrival time","","46","1","26","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We find, in common with many other studies, that removing edge crossings is the most significant aesthetic, but also discover that aligning nodes and edges to an underlying grid is important. We observe that the aesthetics favored by participants during creation of a graph drawing are often not evident in the final product and that the participants did not make a clear distinction between the processes of creation and layout. Our results suggest that graph drawing systems should integrate automatic layout with the user's manual editing process, and provide facilities to support grid-based graph creation.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5674033","Evaluation/methodology;graphs and networks;user interfaces.","Layout;Humans;Algorithm design and analysis;Interviews;Education;Computer science;Electronic mail","computational geometry;graph theory","graph drawing aesthetics;adjacency lists;interaction methods;sketch interface;formal point-and-click interface;graph editing system;edge crossings","","46","","19","","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specific deformations include distance-based repulsion of scatter plot points, deforming straight-line node-link graph drawings, and as varying the simplification degree of bundled edge graph layouts.

Our technique utilizes stereoscopic depth to highlight regions of interest in a 2D graph by projecting these parts onto a plane closer to the viewpoint of the user. This technique aims to isolate and magnify specific portions of the graph that need to be explored in detail without resorting to other highlighting techniques like color or motion, which can then be reserved to encode other data attributes. This mechanism of stereoscopic highlighting also enables focus+context views by juxtaposing a detailed image of a region of interest with the overall graph, which is visualized at a further depth with correspondingly less detail. In order to validate our technique, we ran a controlled experiment with 16 subjects comparing static visual highlighting to stereoscopic highlighting on 2D and 3D graph layouts for a range of tasks. Our results show that while for most tasks the difference in performance between stereoscopic highlighting alone and static visual highlighting is not statistically significant, users performed better when both highlighting methods were used concurrently. In more complicated tasks, 3D layout with static visual highlighting outperformed 2D layouts with a single highlighting method. However, it did not outperform the 2D layout utilizing both highlighting techniques simultaneously. Based on these results, we conclude that stereoscopic highlighting is a promising technique that can significantly enhance graph visualizations for certain use cases.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064999","Graph visualization;stereo displays;virtual reality.","Two dimensional displays;Graphics;Stereo image processing;Data visualization;Image color analysis","data visualisation;graph theory;three-dimensional displays","stereoscopic highlighting;2D graph visualization;stereo displays;data attributes;focus+context views;static visual highlighting;3D layout;2D layout","","46","","30","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Algorithmic search mechanisms used for larger data sets become expensive as the data size increases and typically focus on frequency of occurrence to reduce the computational complexity, often overlooking important infrequent sequences and outliers. In this paper we introduce an interactive visual data mining approach based on an adaptation of techniques developed for Web searching, combined with an intuitive visual interface, to facilitate user-centred exploration of the data and identification of sequences significant to that user. The search algorithm used in the exploration executes in negligible time, even for large data, and so no pre-processing of the selected data is required, making this a completely interactive experience for the user.

We do this by adding a second phase to PLP which uses image-space techniques for determining the visibility status of the remaining geometry. Another contribution of our work is to show how to efficiently implement such image-space visibility queries using currently available OpenGL hardware and extensions.

Dealing with these lengths is a challenge, especially for large graphs. Stress models are often employed in this situation. However, the traditional full stress model is not scalable due to its reliance on an initial all-pairs shortest path calculation. A number of fast approximation algorithms have been proposed. While they work well for some graphs, the results are less satisfactory on graphs of intrinsically high dimension, because some nodes may be placed too close together, or even share the same position. We propose a solution, called the maxent-stress model, which applies the principle of maximum entropy to cope with the extra degrees of freedom. We describe a force-augmented stress majorization algorithm that solves the maxent-stress model. Numerical results show that the algorithm scales well, and provides acceptable layouts for large, nonrigid graphs.

Capitalizing on recent advances in matrix approximation and decomposition, EV presents a probabilistic multidimensional projection model in the low-rank text subspace with a sound objective function. The probability of each document proportion to the topics is obtained through iterative optimization and embedded to a low dimensional space using parameter embedding. By selecting the representative exemplars, we obtain a compact approximation of the data. This makes the visualization highly efficient and flexible. In addition, the selected exemplars neatly summarize the entire data set and greatly reduce the cognitive overload in the visualization, leading to an easier interpretation of large text corpus.

We then give a practical framework for adjusting singularity graphs by automatically modifying the rotational transition of frames between charts (cells of a tetrahedral mesh for the volume) to resolve the issues detected in the internal and boundary singularity graph. After applying an additional re-smoothing of the frame field with the modified transition conditions, we cut the volume into a topologically trivial domain, with the original topology encoded by the self-intersections of the boundary of the domain, and solve a mixed integer problem on this domain for a global parameterization.

Despite the superhuman performance, in-depth understanding of the model and interpreting the sophisticated behaviors of the DQN agent remain to be challenging tasks, due to the long-time model training process and the large number of experiences dynamically generated by the agent. In this work, we propose DQNViz, a visual analytics system to expose details of the blind training process in four levels, and enable users to dive into the large experience space of the agent for comprehensive analysis. As an initial attempt in visualizing DQN models, our work focuses more on Atari games with a simple action space, most notably the Breakout game. From our visual analytics of the agent's experiences, we extract useful action/reward patterns that help to interpret the model and control the training.

Several visual duplication designs are discussed and a controlled experiment comparing network visualization with and without duplication is performed, using 6 tasks that are impor tant for graph readability and visual interpretation of social networks. We show that in our experiment, duplications significantly improve community-related tasks but sometimes interfere with other graph readability tasks. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for deciding when to duplicate actors and choosing candidates for duplication, and alternative ways to render them in social network representations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4658145","Index Terms—;Clustering;Graph Visualization;Node Duplications;Social Networks","Social network services;Clustering;Layout;Communities","data visualisation;graph theory;pattern clustering;social sciences computing","social network visualization;node duplication;clustering method;group actor;graph readability","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Theoretical;Social Support;User-Computer Interface","41","2","32","IEEE","24 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this framework, using mobile phone data to perform transit analysis and optimization represents a new frontier with significant societal impact, especially in developing countries. In this paper we present AllAboard, an intelligent tool that analyses cellphone data to help city authorities in visually exploring urban mobility and optimizing public transport. This is performed within a self contained tool, as opposed to the current solutions which rely on a combination of several distinct tools for analysis, reporting, optimisation and planning. An interactive user interface allows transit operators to visually explore the travel demand in both space and time, correlate it with the transit network, and evaluate the quality of service that a transit network provides to the citizens at very fine grain. Operators can visually test scenarios for transit network improvements, and compare the expected impact on the travellers' experience.

One use of supercomputers is to generate field lines from large scale flow fields. When generating field lines in parallel, the vector field is generally decomposed into blocks, which are then assigned to processors. Since various regions of the vector field can have different flow complexity, processors will require varying amounts of computation time to trace their particles, causing load imbalance, and thus limiting the performance speedup. To achieve load-balanced streamline generation, we propose a workload-aware partitioning algorithm to decompose the vector field into partitions with near equal workloads. Since actual workloads are unknown beforehand, we propose a workload estimation algorithm to predict the workload in the local vector field. A graph-based representation of the vector field is employed to generate these estimates. Once the workloads have been estimated, our partitioning algorithm is hierarchically applied to distribute the workload to all partitions. We examine the performance of our workload estimation and workload-aware partitioning algorithm in several timings studies, which demonstrates that by employing these methods, better scalability can be achieved with little overhead.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064941","Flow visualization;Parallel processing;3D vector field visualization;Streamlines.","Partitioning algorithms;Cost function;Mathematical model","data visualisation;graph theory;parallel processing;resource allocation","load balanced parallel streamline generation;large scale vector fields;flow complexity;load imbalance;workload aware partitioning algorithm;workload estimation algorithm;graph based representation","","40","","24","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper is strongly inspired by the observation in human vision and perception that a sudden change in the luminance plays a critical role to faithfully represent and recover the 3D information. In particular, we adopt the edge detection techniques in image processing for 3D shape visualization and present Photic Extremum Lines (PELs) which emphasize significant variations of illumination over 3D surfaces. Comparing with the existing feature lines, PELs are more flexible and offer users more freedom to achieve desirable visualization effects. In addition, the user can easily control the shape visualization by changing the light position, the number of light sources, and choosing various light models.

The user explores the network by changing the focal node in the detailed view or by changing the level of detail of a node or cluster. For scalability, fast force-based layout algorithms are used for the overview and the detailed view. However, using the same layout algorithm in both views is problematic since layout for the detailed view has different requirements to that in the overview. Here we present a model in which constrained graph layout algorithms are used for layout in the detailed view. This means the detailed view has high-quality layout including sophisticated edge routing and is customisable by the user who can add placement constraints on the layout. Scalability is still ensured since the slower layout techniques are only applied to the small subgraph shown in the detailed view. The main technical innovations are techniques to ensure that the overview and detailed view remain synchronized, and modifying constrained graph layout algorithms to support smooth, stable layout. The key innovation supporting stability are new dynamic graph layout algorithms that preserve the topology or structure of the network when the user changes the focus node or the level of detail by in situ semantic zooming.

As dynamic networks exhibit different characteristics, e.g., being of sparse or dense structure, or having a continuous or discrete time line, a variety of visualization techniques have been specifically designed to handle these different aspects of network structure and time. This wide range of existing techniques is well justified, as rarely a single visualization is suitable to cover the entire visual analysis. Instead, visual representations are often switched in the course of the exploration of dynamic graphs as the focus of analysis shifts between the temporal and the structural aspects of the data. To support such a switching in a seamless and intuitive manner, we introduce the concept of in situ visualization- a novel strategy that tightly integrates existing visualization techniques for dynamic networks. It does so by allowing the user to interactively select in a base visualization a region for which a different visualization technique is then applied and embedded in the selection made. This permits to change the way a locally selected group of data items, such as nodes or time points, are shown - right in the place where they are positioned, thus supporting the user's overall mental map. Using this approach, a user can switch seamlessly between different visual representations to adapt a region of a base visualization to the specifics of the data within it or to the current analysis focus. This paper presents and discusses the in situ visualization strategy and its implications for dynamic graph visualization. Furthermore, it illustrates its usefulness by employing it for the visual exploration of dynamic networks from two different fields: model versioning and wireless mesh networks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065000","Dynamic graph data;multiform visualization;multi-focus+context.","Data visualization;Graphics","data visualisation;graph theory;network theory (graphs)","large dynamic networks;in situ exploration;bot nets;social networks;visualization techniques;network structure;visual analysis;visual representations;mental map;dynamic graph visualization;model versioning;wireless mesh networks","","39","1","51","","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present Summit, an interactive system that scalably and systematically summarizes and visualizes what features a deep learning model has learned and how those features interact to make predictions. Summit introduces two new scalable summarization techniques: (1) activation aggregation discovers important neurons, and (2) neuron-influence aggregation identifies relationships among such neurons. Summit combines these techniques to create the novel attribution graph that reveals and summarizes crucial neuron associations and substructures that contribute to a model's outcomes. Summit scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images, and leverages neural network feature visualization and dataset examples to help users distill large, complex neural network models into compact, interactive visualizations. We present neural network exploration scenarios where Summit helps us discover multiple surprising insights into a prevalent, large-scale image classifier's learned representations and informs future neural network architecture design.

Several preliminary studies have demonstrated the benefits and effectiveness of this modality. Unfortunately, previous work cannot guarantee that an existing anomaly will be detected, especially for complex organs with multiple branches. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reliable navigation, which ensures the interior organ surface is fully examined by the physician performing the virtual endoscopy procedure. To achieve this, we propose computing a reliable fly-through path that ensures no blind areas during the navigation. Theoretically, we discuss the criteria of evaluating a reliable path and prove that the problem of generating an optimal reliable path for virtual endoscopy is NP-complete. In practice, we develop an efficient method for the calculation of an effective reliable path. First, a small set of center observation points are automatically located inside the hollow organ. For each observation point, there exists at least one patch of interior surface visible to it, but that cannot be seen from any of the other observation points. These chosen points are then linked with a path that stays in the center of the organ. Finally, new points inside the organ are recursively selected and connected into the path until the entire organ surface is visible from the path. We present encouraging results from experiments on several data sets. For a medium-size volumetric model with several hundred thousand inner voxels, an effective reliable path can be generated in several minutes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.965347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=965347","","Endoscopes;Humans;Navigation;Cameras;Reliability theory;Automatic control;Switches;Helium;Biomedical imaging;Computer graphics","path planning;computational complexity;optimisation;medical image processing;visibility;reliability;computerised navigation;data visualisation","virtual endoscopy;computerized noninvasive procedure;human organs examination;anomaly detection;organ branches;reliable navigation;interior organ surface;optimal reliable fly-through path;blind areas;NP-complete problem;center observation points;hollow organ;visibility;recursively selected points;volumetric model;inner voxels;camera control","","38","2","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to avoid that the map partly gets too dense, cartographers have designed mapping functions that enlarge a user-defined focus region - such functions are sometimes called fish-eye projections. The extra map space occupied by the enlarged focus region is compensated by distorting other parts of the map. We argue that, in a map showing a network of roads relevant to the user, distortion should preferably take place in those areas where the network is sparse. Therefore, we do not apply a predefined mapping function. Instead, we consider the road network as a graph whose edges are the road segments. We compute a new spatial mapping with a graph-based optimization approach, minimizing the square sum of distortions at edges. Our optimization method is based on a convex quadratic program (CQP); CQPs can be solved in polynomial time. Important requirements on the output map are expressed as linear inequalities. In particular, we show how to forbid edge crossings. We have implemented our method in a prototype tool. For instances of different sizes, our method generated output maps that were far less distorted than those generated with a predefined fish-eye projection. Future work is needed to automate the selection of roads relevant to the user.

To obtain this representation, we describe a novel mechanism based on the extraction of extremum graphs−sparse subsets of the Morse-Smale complex that retain the important structural information without the clutter and occlusion problems that arise from visualizing the entire complex directly. Extremum graphs form a natural multiresolution structure that allows the user to suppress noise and enhance topological features via the specification of a persistence range.

By deriving transition probabilities among states, we construct a global map that captures the essential transition relationships in the time-varying data. We introduce the TransGraph, a graph-based representation to visualize hierarchical state transition relationships. The TransGraph not only provides a visual mapping that abstracts data evolution over time in different levels of detail, but also serves as a navigation tool that guides data exploration and tracking.

However, a perspective that is missing is the impact of these sampling strategies on the resultant visualizations. In this paper, we present the results of three user studies that investigate how sampling strategies influence node-link visualizations of graphs. In particular, five sampling strategies widely used in the graph mining literature are tested to determine how well they preserve visual features in node-link diagrams.

Today, isosurfaces are most often visualized by extracting a polygonal approximation that is then rendered via graphics hardware or by using a special variant of preintegrated volume rendering. However, these approaches have a number of limitations in terms of the quality of the isosurface, lack of performance for complex data sets, or supported shading models. An alternative isosurface rendering method that does not suffer from these limitations is to directly ray trace the isosurface. However, this approach has been much too slow for interactive applications unless massively parallel shared-memory supercomputers have been used. In this paper, we implement interactive isosurface ray tracing on commodity desktop PCs by building on recent advances in real-time ray tracing of polygonal scenes and using those to improve isosurface ray tracing performance as well. The high performance and scalability of our approach will be demonstrated with several practical examples, including the visualization of highly complex isosurface data sets, the interactive rendering of hybrid polygonal/isosurface scenes, including high-quality ray traced shading effects, and even interactive global illumination on isosurfaces.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1471693","Index Terms- Ray tracing;real-time rendering;isosurface;visualization;global illumination.","Isosurfaces;Ray tracing;Rendering (computer graphics);Data visualization;Layout;Data mining;Graphics;Hardware;Supercomputers;Personal communication networks","ray tracing;rendering (computer graphics);data visualisation;solid modelling;interactive systems;real-time systems;computational geometry;lighting;computer graphic equipment;tree data structures","interactive isosurface ray tracing;implicit KD-trees;high-quality isosurface visualization;polygonal approximation;interactive isosurface rendering;graphics hardware;volume rendering;isosurface quality;shading model;parallel shared-memory supercomputer;real-time ray tracing;polygonal scenes;interactive global illumination;real-time rendering","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","35","4","35","","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, any particular drawing approach cannot fully satisfy all these criteria simultaneously, producing drawings with visual ambiguities that can impede the understanding of network structure. To bring attention to these potentially problematic areas present in the drawing, this paper presents a technique that highlights common types of visual ambiguities: ambiguous spatial relationships between nodes and edges, visual overlap between community structures, and ambiguity in edge bundling and metanodes. Metrics, including newly proposed metrics for abnormal edge lengths, visual overlap in community structures and node/edge aggregation, are proposed to quantify areas of ambiguity in the drawing. These metrics and others are then displayed using a heatmap-based visualization that provides visual feedback to developers of graph drawing and visualization approaches, allowing them to quickly identify misleading areas. The novel metrics and the heatmap-based visualization allow a user to explore ambiguities in graph layouts from multiple perspectives in order to make reasonable graph layout choices. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through case studies and expert reviews.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467691","HK RGC GRF(grant numbers:618313); Huawei Co.

We present two rectangle-packing algorithms for placing items of hierarchical data onto display spaces. The algorithms refer to Delaunay triangular meshes connecting the centers of rectangles to find gaps where rectangles can be placed. The first algorithm places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the extension of the layout area is minimal. The second algorithm places rectangles by referring to templates describing the ideal positions for nodes of input data. It places rectangles where they do not overlap each other and where the combination of the layout area and the distances between the positions described in the template and the actual positions is minimal.

Edge-bundling techniques are designed to reduce edge clutter in node-link diagrams by coalescing lines into common paths or bundles. Unfortunately, traditional bundling techniques introduce ambiguity since edges are only bundled by spatial proximity, rather than network connectivity; following an edge from its source to its target can lead to the perception of incorrect connectivity if edges are not clearly separated within the bundles. Contrary, CDs bundle edges based on common sources or targets. Thus, a smooth path along a confluent bundle indicates precise connectivity. While CDs have been described in theory, practical investigation and application to real-world networks (i.e., networks beyond those with certain planarity restrictions) is currently lacking. Here, we provide the first algorithm for constructing CDs from arbitrary directed and undirected networks and present a simple layout method, embedded in a sand box environment providing techniques for interactive exploration. We then investigate patterns and artifacts in CDs, which we compare to other common edge-bundling techniques. Finally, we present the first user study that compares edge-compression techniques, including CD, power graphs, metro-style, and common edge bundling. We found that users without particular expertise in visualization or network analysis are able to read small CDs without difficulty.

In this work, we introduce a concise yet complete interpolation scheme of vector fields on arbitrary triangulated surfaces. The scheme enables arbitrary singularities to be represented at vertices. The representation can be considered as a facet-based ""encoding"" of vector fields on piecewise linear surfaces. The vector field is described in polar coordinates over each facet, with a facet edge being chosen as the reference to define the angle. An integer called the period jump is associated to each edge of the triangulation to remove the ambiguity when interpolating the direction of the vector field between two facets that share an edge. To interpolate the vector field, we first linearly interpolate the angle of rotation of the vectors along the edges of the facet graph. Then, we use a variant of Nielson's side-vertex scheme to interpolate the vector field over the entire surface. With our representation, we remove the bound imposed on the complexity of singularities that a vertex can represent by its connectivity. This bound is a limitation generally exists in vertex-based linear schemes.

Partition-based methods are efficient means in realizing this objective. Although some algorithms exist for support-free fabrication of solid models, no algorithm ever considers the problem of support-free fabrication for shell models (i.e., hollowed meshes). In this paper, we present a skeleton-based algorithm for partitioning a 3D surface model into the least number of parts for 3D printing without using any support structure. To achieve support-free fabrication while minimizing the effect of the seams and cracks that are inevitably induced by the partition, which affect the aesthetics and strength of the final assembled surface, we put forward an optimization system with the minimization of the number of partitions and the total length of the cuts, under the constraints of support-free printing angle. Our approach is particularly tailored for shell models, and it can be applicable to solid models as well. We first rigorously show that the optimization problem is NP-hard and then propose a stochastic method to find an optimal solution to the objectives. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm for a special case when the skeleton graph satisfies the requirement that the number of partitioned parts and the degree of each node are bounded by a small constant. We evaluate our partition method on a number of 3D models and validate our method by 3D printing experiments.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2767047","Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:16YF1405500); Shanghai Jiao Tong University(grant numbers:AF0200163); State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Systems and Vibration(grant numbers:MSVZD201505); The National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51605290,61502306); China Young 1000 Talents Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8086214","3D printing;skeleton;model partition;support-free","Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Fabrication;Three-dimensional printing;Skeleton;Computational modeling","computational complexity;graph theory;optimisation;solid modelling;three-dimensional printing","support-free 3D printing;support structures minimization;skeleton graph;polynomial-time algorithm;support-free printing angle;3D surface model;skeleton-based algorithm;solid models;support-free fabrication;partition-based methods;partitioning models","","33","","58","IEEE","27 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, classifying data points as noise in order to reduce a data set bears special relevance for many application domains. Standard methods such as clustering serve to reduce problem complexity by providing the user with classes of similar entities. However, they usually do not highlight relations between different entities and require a stopping criterion, e.g. the number of clusters to be detected. In this paper, we present a visualization pipeline based on recent advancements in algebraic topology. More precisely, we employ methods from persistent homology that enable topological data analysis on high-dimensional data sets. Our pipeline inherently copes with noisy data and data sets of arbitrary dimensions. It extracts central structures of a data set in a hierarchical manner by using a persistence-based filtering algorithm that is theoretically well-founded. We furthermore introduce persistence rings, a novel visualization technique for a class of topological features-the persistence intervals-of large data sets. Persistence rings provide a unique topological signature of a data set, which helps in recognizing similarities. In addition, we provide interactive visualization techniques that assist the user in evaluating the parameter space of our method in order to extract relevant structures. We describe and evaluate our analysis pipeline by means of two very distinct classes of data sets: First, a class of synthetic data sets containing topological objects is employed to highlight the interaction capabilities of our method.

In this context, we propose a novel contouring algorithm for the construction of a discrete Reeb graph with a minimal number of nodes, which correspond to the critical points of f (i.e., minima, maxima, and saddle points) and its level sets passing through the saddle points. In this way, we do not need to sample, sweep, or increasingly sort the f-values. Since most of the computation uses only local information on the mesh connectivity, equipped with the f-values at the surface vertices, the proposed approach is insensitive to noise and requires a small-memory footprint and temporary data structures. Furthermore, we maintain the parametric nature of the Reeb graph with respect to the input scalar function and we efficiently extract the Reeb graph of time-varying maps. Indicating with n and s the number of vertices of M and saddle points of f, the overall computational cost O(sn) is competitive with respect to the O(n log n) cost of previous work. This cost becomes optimal if M is highly sampled or s les log n, as it happens for Laplacian eigenfunctions, harmonic maps, and one-forms.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770097","Reeb graph;topological graph;Morse theory;computational topology;geometric algorithms;hierarchical segmentations;shape analysis and abstraction.","Shape;Level set;Topology;Data structures;Data mining;Computational efficiency;Cost function;Laplace equations;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Algorithm design and analysis","computational complexity;data structures;graph theory","minimal contouring algorithm;discrete Reeb graph;continuous scalar function;high-level descriptor;saddle point;critical point;small-memory footprint;temporary data structure;time-varying map;Laplacian eigenfunction;harmonic map;mesh connectivity;surface vertex","","31","","54","","2 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead of recovering the depth map, the proposed method synthesizes the binocular parallax in stereoscopic video directly from the motion parallax in monocular video, The synthesis is formulated as an optimization problem via introducing a cost function of the stereoscopic effects, the similarity, and the smoothness constraints. The optimization selects the most suitable frames in the input video for generating the stereoscopic video frames. With the optimized selection, convincing and smooth stereoscopic video can be synthesized even by simple constant-depth warping. No user interaction is required. We demonstrate the visually plausible results obtained given the input clips acquired by ordinary handheld video camera.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.1032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293013","Stereoscopic video synthesis;parallax;optimization.","Cameras;Layout;Robustness;Stereo vision;Constraint optimization;Cost function;Iterative algorithms;Visualization;Three dimensional TV;Hardware","image motion analysis;optimisation;stereo image processing;video signal processing","stereoscopic video synthesis;monocular video;depth map;binocular parallax;motion parallax;optimization problem;stereoscopic video frames","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Photogrammetry;Video Recording","31","15","32","","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is because objects within the same community usually have at least one property in common. The investigation of community structure can therefore support the understanding of object attributes from the network topology alone. In real-world systems, objects may belong to several communities at the same time, i.e., communities can overlap. Analyzing fuzzy community memberships is essential to understand to what extent objects contribute to different communities and whether some communities are highly interconnected. We developed a visualization approach that is based on node-link diagrams and supports the investigation of fuzzy communities in weighted undirected graphs at different levels of detail. Starting with the network of communities, the user can continuously drill down to the network of individual nodes and finally analyze the membership distribution of nodes of interest. Our approach uses layout strategies and further visual mappings to graphically encode the fuzzy community memberships. The usefulness of our approach is illustrated by two case studies analyzing networks of different domains: social networking and biological interactions. The case studies showed that our layout and visualization approach helps investigate fuzzy overlapping communities. Fuzzy vertices as well as the different communities to which they belong can be easily identified based on node color and position.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634179","Communities;Layout;Fuzzy methods;Uncertainty;Image color analysis;Data visualization;uncertainty visualization;Overlapping community visualization;fuzzy clustering;graph visualization","Communities;Layout;Fuzzy methods;Uncertainty;Image color analysis;Data visualization","data visualisation;fuzzy set theory;graph theory","visualizing fuzzy overlapping community;community structure;object attributes;network topology;real-world systems;fuzzy community memberships;visualization approach;node-link diagrams;weighted undirected graphs;membership distribution;layout strategy;visual mappings;social networking;biological interactions;node color;node position","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Fuzzy Logic;Image Enhancement;Models, Statistical;User-Computer Interface","31","","53","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Selecting a “good” layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity assessed by human users.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2743858","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1320229,IIS-1528203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8017580","Graph visualization;graph layout;aesthetics;machine learning;graph kernel;graphlet","Kernel;Layout;Measurement;Visualization;Inspection;Data visualization;Support vector machines","data visualisation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","graph kernel;graph look;graph visualization;viewer perceives different information;visual inspection;visual appearances;aesthetic metrics;topological similarity;estimation calculation;perceptual similarity;machine learning","Adolescent;Adult;Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Esthetics;Female;Humans;Machine Learning;Male;Task Performance and Analysis;Young Adult","31","","92","IEEE","29 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, its practical use often involves a tedious and time-consuming process of tuning parameters and making application-specific choices. In the absence of training data with labeled clusters, help from a human analyst is required to decide the number of clusters, to determine whether hierarchical clustering is needed, and to define the appropriate distance measures, parameters of the underlying graph, and type of graph Laplacian. We propose to simplify this process via an open-box approach, in which an interactive system visualizes the involved mathematical quantities, suggests parameter values, and provides immediate feedback to support the required decisions. Our framework focuses on applications in 3D image analysis, and links the abstract high-dimensional feature space used in spectral clustering to the three-dimensional data space. This provides a better understanding of the technique, and helps the analyst predict how well specific parameter settings will generalize to similar tasks. In addition, our system supports filtering outliers and labeling the final clusters in such a way that user actions can be recorded and transferred to different data in which the same structures are to be found. Our system supports a wide range of inputs, including triangular meshes, regular grids, and point clouds. We use our system to develop segmentation protocols in chest CT and brain MRI that are then successfully applied to other datasets in an automated manner.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634089","Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laplace equations;Image analysis;Data visualization;Clustering;programming with example;Image segmentation;spectral clustering;high-dimensional embeddings;linked views","Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laplace equations;Image analysis;Data visualization;Clustering","biomedical MRI;computerised tomography;data visualisation;graph theory;medical image processing;pattern clustering","open-box spectral clustering;medical image analysis;3D image analysis;tuning parameters;hierarchical clustering;distance measures;graph parameter;Laplacian graph type;three-dimensional data space;segmentation protocols;chest CT;computerised tomography;brain MRI;magnetic resonance imaging","Algorithms;Brain;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","30","2","53","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key idea in the proposed approach is to maximally leverage the efficient contour tree algorithm to compute the Reeb graph. The algorithm proceeds by dividing the input into a set of subvolumes that have loop-free Reeb graphs using the join tree of the scalar function and computes the Reeb graph by combining the contour trees of all the subvolumes. Since the key ingredient of this method is a series of union-find operations, the algorithm is fast in practice. Experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms current generic algorithms by a factor of up to two orders of magnitude, and has a performance on par with algorithms that are catered to restricted classes of input.

Most of the previous researches of human motion indexing and retrieval compute the Euclidean distance of joint angles or joint positions. Such approaches are difficult to apply for cases in which multiple characters are closely interacting with each other, as the relationships of the characters are not encoded in the representation. In this research, we propose a topology-based approach to index the motions of two human characters in close contact. We compute and encode how the two bodies are tangled based on the concept of rational tangles. The encoded relationships, which we define as {\it TangleList}, are used to determine the similarity of the pairs of postures. Using our method, we can index and retrieve motions such as one person piggy-backing another, one person assisting another in walking, and two persons dancing / wrestling. Our method is useful to manage a motion database of multiple characters. We can also produce motion graph structures of two characters closely interacting with each other by interpolating and concatenating topologically similar postures and motion clips, which are applicable to 3D computer games and computer animation.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4731251","Animation;Face and gesture recognition","Indexing;Animation;Humans;Databases;Information retrieval;Neck;Content based retrieval;Concatenated codes;Euclidean distance;Legged locomotion","avatars;computational geometry;computer animation;content-based retrieval;database indexing;interpolation;visual databases","human character motion indexing;human character motion retrieval;computer animation;motion database;Euclidean distance;topology-based approach;TangleList encoded relationship;motion graph structure;interpolation method;3D computer game;content-based retrieval;human character interaction;avatars","Abstracting and Indexing as Topic;Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","29","","27","IEEE","16 Mar 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This permits us to build Euler diagrams inductively, adding one curve at a time. Our technique is adaptable, allowing the easy specification, and enforcement, of sets of well-formedness conditions; we present a series of results that identify properties of cycles that correspond to the well-formedness conditions. This improves upon other contributions toward the automated generation of Euler diagrams which implicitly assume some fixed set of well-formedness conditions must hold.

The effectiveness of this approach depends on how the visual variables chosen for representing uncertainty and other attributes interact to influence the user's perception of each variable. We report a user study on the perception of graph edge attributes when uncertainty associated with each edge and the main edge attribute are visualized simultaneously using two separate visual variables. The study covers four visual variables that are commonly used for visualizing uncertainty on line graphical primitives: lightness, grain, fuzziness, and transparency. We select width, hue, and saturation for visualizing the main edge attribute and hypothesize that we can observe interference between the visual variable chosen to encode the main edge attribute and that to encode uncertainty, as suggested by the concept of dimensional integrality. Grouping the seven visual variables as color-based, focus-based, or geometry-based, we further hypothesize that the degree of interference is affected by the groups to which the two visual variables belong. We consider two further factors in the study: discriminability level for each visual variable as a factor intrinsic to the visual variables and graph-task type (visual search versus comparison) as a factor extrinsic to the visual variables. Our results show that the effectiveness of a visual variable in depicting uncertainty is strongly mediated by all the factors examined here. Focus-based visual variables (fuzziness, grain, and transparency) are robust to the choice of visual variables for encoding the main edge attribute, though fuzziness has stronger negative impact on the perception of width and transparency has stronger negative impact on the perception of hue than the other uncertainty visual variables. We found that interference between hue and lightness is much greater than that between saturation and lightness, though all three are color-based visual variables. We also found a compound relationship between discriminability level and the degree of dimensional integrality. We discuss the generalizability and limitation of the results and conclude with design considerations for visualizing graph uncertainty derived from these results, including recommended choices of visual variables when the relative importance of data attributes and graph tasks is known.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2424872","IIS(grant numbers:IIS-10-18769); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7089294","Visual variable;perception;uncertainty visualization;graph visualization;Visual variable;perception;uncertainty visualization;graph visualization","Visualization;Uncertainty;Encoding;Data visualization;Image color analysis;Accuracy;Interference","computational geometry;data visualisation;graph theory","uncertainty representation;paired-visual variable evaluation;data visualization;user perception;graph edge attributes;line graphical primitives;lightness attribute;grain attribute;fuzziness attribute;transparency attribute;width attribute;hue attribute;saturation attribute;visual variable;uncertainty encoding;dimensional integrality;color-based visual variable;focus-based visual variable;geometry-based visual variable;interference degree;discriminability level;intrinsic factor;graph-task type;focus-based visual variables;color-based visual variables;graph uncertainty visualization;data attributes","","28","","40","IEEE","20 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two orthogonal axes are used: one for all nodes of the displayed graph, the other for the corresponding links. Colors and labels are employed to identify the nodes. The usage of color allows us to scale the visualization to single pixel level for large graphs. In contrast to other techniques, we employ an asymmetric mapping that results in an aligned and compact representation of links. Our approach is independent of the specific properties of the graph to be visualized, but certain graphs and tasks benefit from the asymmetry. As we show in our results, the strength of our technique is the visualization of dynamic graphs. In particular, sparse graphs benefit from the compact representation.

Tracking temporal changes at scale in these networks is challenging due in part to the fact that small changes can be missed or drowned-out by the rest of the network. For static networks, current approaches allow the identification of specific network elements within their context. However, in the case of dynamic networks, the user is left alone with finding salient local network elements and tracking them over time. In this work, we introduce a modular DoI specification to flexibly define what salient changes are and to assign them a measure of their importance in a time-varying setting. The specification takes into account neighborhood structure information, numerical attributes of nodes/edges, and their temporal evolution. A tailored visualization of the DoI specification complements our approach. Alongside a traditional node-link view of the dynamic network, it serves as an interface for the interactive definition of a DoI function. By using it to successively refine and investigate the captured details, it supports the analysis of dynamic networks from an initial view until pinpointing a user's analysis goal. We report on applying our approach to scientific coauthorship networks and give concrete results for the DBLP data set.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574858","Time-varying graphs;dynamic graph visualization;degree-of-interest","Visualization;Context;Data visualization;Radiation detectors;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Navigation","formal specification;graph theory","modular degree-of-interest specification;visual analysis;large dynamic networks;static networks;local network elements;structure information;numerical attributes;temporal evolution;tailored visualization;DoI specification complements;dynamic network;interactive definition","","27","","37","","5 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This significantly impacts the quality of global, low-dimensional space embedding procedures such as the popular multidimensional scaling (MDS) where one can often observe nonintuitive layouts. We were inspired by the perceptual processes evoked in the method of parallel coordinates which enables users to visually aggregate the data by the patterns the polylines exhibit across the dimension axes. We call the path of such a polyline its structure and suggest a metric that captures this structure directly in high-dimensional space. This allows us to better gauge the distances of spatially distant data constellations and so achieve data aggregations in MDS plots that are more cognizant of existing high-dimensional structure similarities. Our biscale framework distinguishes far-distances from near-distances. The coarser scale uses the structural similarity metric to separate data aggregates obtained by prior classification or clustering, while the finer scale employs the appropriate euclidean distance.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560006","Information visualization;multivariate visualization;clustering;high-dimensional data;visual analytics","Layout;Euclidean distance;Correlation;Indexes;Data visualization;Extraterrestrial measurements","computational geometry;data visualisation;embedded systems","structure-based distance metric;high-dimensional space exploration;multidimensional scaling;low-dimensional space embedding procedures;polylines pattern;spatially distant data constellations","","27","","32","","16 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A key advantage of our method is that it can directly visualize higher-order state transitions. A standard first order state transition is a sequence of two states that are linked by a transition. A higher-order state transition is a sequence of three or more states where the sequence of participating states are linked together by consecutive first order state transitions. Our method extends the current state-graph exploration methods by employing a two dimensional graph, in which higher-order state transitions are visualized as curved lines. All transitions are bundled into thick splines, so that the thickness of an edge represents the frequency of instances. The bundling between two states takes into account the state transitions before and after the transition. This is done in such a way that it forms a continuous representation in which any subsequence of the timeseries is represented by a continuous smooth line. The edge bundles in these graphs can be explored interactively through our incremental selection algorithm. We demonstrate our method with an application in exploring labeled time-series data from a biological survey, where a clustering has assigned a single label to the data at each time-point. In these sequences, a large number of cyclic patterns occur, which in turn are linked to specific activities. We demonstrate how our method helps to find these cycles, and how the interactive selection process helps to find and investigate activities.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290701","State transitions;Graph drawing;Time series;Biological data","Data visualization;Frequency;Clustering algorithms","biology computing;graph theory;splines (mathematics);time series","smooth graphs;higher-order state transitions;state sequences;large observational time series;state-graph exploration methods;splines;biological data","Animals;Behavior, Animal;Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Computer Graphics;Databases, Factual;Spheniscidae;Time Factors","27","1","23","","23 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resultant scatterplot, which reflects the similarities of the vectors, allows analysts to examine the graph structures and their corresponding real-life interpretations through repeated use of brushing and linking between the two visualizations. The interpretation of the graph structures is based on the outcomes of multiple participatory analysis sessions with intelligence analysts conducted by the authors at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Based on a general I/O model, we derive new cache-aware and cache-oblivious metrics that have high correlations with the number of cache misses when accessing a mesh. In addition to guiding the layout process, our metrics can be used to quantify the quality of a layout, e.g. for comparing different layouts of the same mesh and for determining whether a given layout is amenable to significant improvement.

As a result, recent work in the visualization community has focused either on designing sequential access compression schemes or on producing cache-coherent layouts of (uncompressed) meshes for random access. Unfortunately combining these two strategies is challenging as they fundamentally assume conflicting modes of data access. In this paper, we propose a novel order-preserving compression method that supports transparent random access to compressed triangle meshes. Our decompression method selectively fetches from disk, decodes, and caches in memory requested parts of a mesh. We also provide a general mesh access API for seamless mesh traversal and incidence queries. While the method imposes no particular mesh layout, it is especially suitable for cache-oblivious layouts, which minimize the number of decompression I/O requests and provide high cache utilization during access to decompressed, in-memory portions of the mesh. Moreover, the transparency of our scheme enables improved performance without the need for application code changes. We achieve compression rates on the order of 20:1 and significantly improved I/O performance due to reduced data transfer. To demonstrate the benefits of our method, we implement two common applications as benchmarks. By using cache-oblivious layouts for the input models, we observe 2-6 times overall speedup compared to using uncompressed meshes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4376184","Mesh compression;random access;cache-coherent layouts;mesh data structures;external memory algorithms","Bandwidth;Data visualization;Data structures;Memory management;Delay;Space technology;Cache storage;Decoding;Computer displays;Computational modeling","application program interfaces;cache storage;computational geometry;mesh generation","cache-oblivious layout;data transfer;I/O request;API;novel order-preserving compression method;cache-coherent layout;sequential access compression scheme;disk storage;multilevel cache;random-accessible compressed triangle mesh","","25","1","44","","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Visualizing graph query results is challenging, requiring effective summarization of a large number of subgraphs, each having potentially shared node-values, rich node features, and flexible structure across queries. We present VIGOR, a novel interactive visual analytics system, for exploring and making sense of query results. VIGOR uses multiple coordinated views, leveraging different data representations and organizations to streamline analysts sensemaking process. VIGOR contributes: (1) an exemplar-based interaction technique, where an analyst starts with a specific result and relaxes constraints to find other similar results or starts with only the structure (i.e., without node value constraints), and adds constraints to narrow in on specific results; and (2) a novel feature-aware subgraph result summarization. Through a collaboration with Symantec, we demonstrate how VIGOR helps tackle real-world problems through the discovery of security blindspots in a cybersecurity dataset with over 11,000 incidents.

Additionally, those parts that do not contain hierarchy are drawn at the same quality expected from a nonhierarchical, undirected layout algorithm. Our experiments show that this new approach is better able to convey the structure of large digraphs than the most widely used hierarchical graph-drawing method.

Our measure for LOD quality is based on the formulation of entropy from information theory. The measure takes into account the distortion and contribution of multiresolution data blocks. A LOD map is generated through the mapping of key LOD ingredients to a treemap representation. The ordered treemap layout is used for relative stable update of the LOD map when the view or LOD changes. This visual interface not only indicates the quality of LODs in an intuitive way, but also provides immediate suggestions for possible LOD improvement through visually-striking features. It also allows us to compare different views and perform rendering budget control. A set of interactive techniques is proposed to make the LOD adjustment a simple and easy task.

The combination of both these components into telepresence systems, however, comes with significant technical challenges. All approaches proposed so far are extremely demanding on input and output devices, compute resources and transmission bandwidth, and they do not reach the level of immediacy required for applications such as remote collaboration. Here, we introduce what we believe is the first practical client-server system for real-time capture and many-user exploration of static 3D scenes. Our system is based on the observation that interactive frame rates are sufficient for capturing and reconstruction, and real-time performance is only required on the client site to achieve lag-free view updates when rendering the 3D model. Starting from this insight, we extend previous voxel block hashing frameworks by introducing a novel thread-safe GPU hash map data structure that is robust under massively concurrent retrieval, insertion and removal of entries on a thread level. We further propose a novel transmission scheme for volume data that is specifically targeted to Marching Cubes geometry reconstruction and enables a 90% reduction in bandwidth between server and exploration clients. The resulting system poses very moderate requirements on network bandwidth, latency and client-side computation, which enables it to rely entirely on consumer-grade hardware, including mobile devices.

First, on the basis of the supergraph, we therefore group nodes and edges according to their associated attributes that are changing over time. Second, the supergraph is visualized to provide an overview of the groups of nodes and edges with similar behavior over time in terms of their associated attributes.

This drawing style is well suited for the visualization of centrality in social networks and similar concepts. Radial drawings also allow a more flexible edge routing than horizontal drawings, as edges can be routed around the center in two directions. In experimental results, this reduces the number of crossings by approximately 30 percent on average. Few crossings are one of the major criteria for human readability. This paper is a detailed description of a complete framework for visualizing hierarchical information in a new radial fashion.

These are good reasons to want instead to capture several smaller sub-scenes that can be joined to make the whole scene. Achieving this has traditionally been difficult: joining sub-scenes that may never have been viewed from the same angle requires a high-quality camera relocaliser that can cope with novel poses, and tracking drift in each sub-scene can prevent them from being joined to make a consistent overall scene. Recent advances, however, have significantly improved our ability to capture medium-sized sub-scenes with little to no tracking drift: real-time globally consistent reconstruction systems can close loops and re-integrate the scene surface on the fly, whilst new visual-inertial odometry approaches can significantly reduce tracking drift during live reconstruction. Moreover, high-quality regression forest-based relocalisers have recently been made more practical by the introduction of a method to allow them to be trained and used online. In this paper, we leverage these advances to present what to our knowledge is the first system to allow multiple users to collaborate interactively to reconstruct dense, voxel-based models of whole buildings using only consumer-grade hardware, a task that has traditionally been both time-consuming and dependent on the availability of specialised hardware.

However, Morse decomposition is not unique, and its granularity directly impacts its computational cost. In this paper, we propose an automatic refinement scheme to construct the Morse Connection Graph (MCG) of a given vector field in a hierarchical fashion. Our framework allows a Morse set to be refined through a local update of the flow combinatorialization graph, as well as the connection regions between Morse sets. The computation is fast because the most expensive computation is concentrated on a small portion of the domain. Furthermore, the present work allows the generation of a topologically consistent hierarchy of MCGs, which cannot be obtained using a global method. The classification of the extracted Morse sets is a crucial step for the construction of the MCG, for which the Poincaré index is inadequate. We make use of an upper bound for the Conley index, provided by the Betti numbers of an index pair for a translation along the flow, to classify the Morse sets. This upper bound is sufficiently accurate for Morse set classification and provides supportive information for the automatic refinement process. An improved visualization technique for MCG is developed to incorporate the Conley indices. Finally, we apply the proposed techniques to a number of synthetic and real-world simulation data to demonstrate their utility.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928334","Morse decomposition;vector field topology;upper bound of Conley index;topology refinement;hierarchical refinement.","Indexes;Topology;Orbits;Approximation methods;Upper bound;Trajectory;Electrocardiography","data visualisation;graph theory;mathematics computing;numerical stability;pattern classification;set theory;topology;vectors","Morse set classification;hierarchical refinement;Conley index;Morse decomposition;vector field;numerically stable topological representation;Morse connection graph;flow combinatorialization graph;Poincare index;Betti numbers;visualization technique;synthetic data;real-world simulation data","","22","","40","","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then perform an experimental study to evaluate the performance of existing graph sampling algorithms regarding minority structure preservation. Results confirm our assumption and suggest key points for designing a new graph sampling approach named mino-centric graph sampling (MCGS). In this approach, a triangle-based algorithm and a cut-point-based algorithm are proposed to efficiently identify minority structures. A set of importance assessment criteria are designed to guide the preservation of important minority structures.

Yet, as discussed in this paper, there remain significant issues in the quality of the layouts produced by these techniques, even for quite small networks. This is especially true when layout with additional grouping constraints is required. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate an ultra-compact, grid-like network layout aesthetic that is motivated by the grid arrangements that are used almost universally by designers in typographical layout. Since the time when these heuristic and pipeline-based graph-layout methods were conceived, generic technologies (MIP, CP and SAT) for solving combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization problems have improved massively. The second contribution of this paper is to reassess whether these techniques can be used for high-quality layout of small graphs. While they are fast enough for graphs of up to 50 nodes we found these methods do not scale up. Our third contribution is a large-neighborhood search meta-heuristic approach that is scalable to larger networks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467251","Australian Research Council through Discovery Project(grant numbers:DP140100077); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192733","Network visualization;graph drawing;power graph;optimization;large-neighborhood search;Network visualization;graph drawing;power graph;optimization;large-neighborhood search","Layout;Encoding;Optimization;Containers;Standards;Routing;Pipelines","complex networks;computability;graph theory;integer programming;large-scale systems;search problems","high-quality ultra-compact grid layout;grouped networks;fast heuristic techniques;complex multistage pipelines;small graphs;pipeline techniques;orthogonal-style layout;small networks;grouping constraints;ultra-compact grid-like network layout aesthetic;grid arrangements;typographical layout;heuristic-based graph-layout methods;pipeline-based graph-layout methods;MIP;CP;SAT;combinatorial problems;mixed-integer optimization problems;large-neighborhood search meta-heuristic approach","","21","","50","IEEE","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SuperMatching takes advantage of supersymmetry to devise an efficient sampling strategy to estimate the affinity tensor, as well as to store the estimated tensor compactly. Matching is performed by an efficient higher order power iteration approach that takes advantage of this compact representation. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that SuperMatching provides more accurate feature matching than other state-of-the-art approaches for a wide range of 2D and 3D features, with competitive computational cost.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6461881","Feature matching;geometric constraints;supersymmetric tensor","Tensile stress;Vectors;Shape;Transmission line matrix methods;Educational institutions;Accuracy;Computational efficiency","feature extraction;geometry;graph theory;image matching;tensors","SuperMatching algorithm;feature matching;supersymmetric geometric constraints;computer graphics;computer vision applications;pointwise approach;pairwise approach;supersymmetric tensor;affinity metric;feature similarity;higher order graph matching problem;sampling strategy;affinity tensor estimation;higher order power iteration approach;2D features;3D features","","21","","43","","14 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These are called stereoscopic HTDs (head-tracked displays). Stereoscopic displays render two perspective views of a scene, each of which is seen by one eye of the user. Ideally, the user's natural visual system combines the stereo image pair into a single, 3D perceived image. Unfortunately, users often have difficulty fusing the stereo image pair. Researchers use a number of software techniques to reduce fusion problems. This paper geometrically examines and compares a number of these techniques and reaches the following conclusions: In interactive stereoscopic applications, the combination of view placement, scale, and either false eye separation or /spl alpha/-false eye separation can provide fusion control that is geometrically similar to image shifting and image scaling. However, in stereo HTDs, image shifting and image scaling also generate additional geometric artifacts that are not generated by the other methods. We anecdotally link some of these artifacts to exceeding the perceptual limitations of human vision. While formal perceptual studies are still needed, geometric analysis suggests that image shifting and image scaling may be less appropriate than the other methods for interactive, stereo HTDs.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.998666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=998666","","Displays;Fusion power generation;Virtual reality;Head;Rendering (computer graphics);Layout;Visual system;Application software;Image generation;Humans","tracking;computer displays;computational geometry;sensor fusion;virtual reality;three-dimensional displays;visual perception;human factors;scaling phenomena;rendering (computer graphics)","fusion control algorithms;geometric comparison;stereoscopic head-tracked displays;virtual reality;stationary display;perspective view rendering;stereo image pair fusion;3D perceived image;software techniques;interactive applications;view placement;scale;false eye separation;image shifting;image scaling;geometric artifacts;human visual perception limitations;display distortion","","20","1","43","","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to overcome these problems, we introduce an infrastructure for supporting the development of specific AR interaction techniques and their adaptation to individual user needs. Our approach is threefold: a flexible AR framework providing independence from particular input devices and rendering platforms, an interaction prototyping mechanism allowing for fast prototyping of new interaction techniques, and a high-level user interface description, extending user interface descriptions into the domain of AR.

The annotation graph topology encodes annotation semantics, which describe the content of and relations between data selections, comments, and tags. We present a mixed-initiative approach to graph layout that integrates an analyst's manual manipulations with an automatic method based on similarity inferred from the annotation semantics. Various visual graph layout styles reveal different perspectives on the annotation semantics. Annotation graphs are implemented within C8, a system that supports authoring annotations during exploratory analysis of a dataset. We apply principles of Exploratory Sequential Data Analysis (ESDA) in designing C8, and further link these to an existing task typology in the visualization literature.

The space-filling curve is oriented such that the first point in each triangle is a vertex shared with the previous triangle and the last point is a vertex shared with the next triangle. Furthermore, our index can be refined locally and, therefore, efficiently when the TIN is augmented by filling any face with another TIN (to make a hierarchical TIN).

Findings and results of the analysis often need to be communicated to an audience that lacks visual analytics expertise. This requires analysis outcomes to be presented in simpler ways than that are typically used in visual analytics systems. However, not only analytical visualizations may be too complex for target audiences but also the information that needs to be presented. Analysis results may consist of multiple components, which may involve multiple heterogeneous facets. Hence, there exists a gap on the path from obtaining analysis findings to communicating them, within which two main challenges lie: information complexity and display complexity. We address this problem by proposing a general framework where data analysis and result presentation are linked by story synthesis, in which the analyst creates and organises story contents. Unlike previous research, where analytic findings are represented by stored display states, we treat findings as data constructs. We focus on selecting, assembling and organizing findings for further presentation rather than on tracking analysis history and enabling dual (i.e., explorative and communicative) use of data displays. In story synthesis, findings are selected, assembled, and arranged in meaningful layouts that take into account the structure of information and inherent properties of its components. We propose a workflow for applying the proposed conceptual framework in designing visual analytics systems and demonstrate the generality of the approach by applying it to two diverse domains, social media and movement analysis.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2889054","Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence; EU in projects DiSIEM and SoBigData; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602340,61572348); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC0809800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585048","Story synthesis;visual analytics;social media;spatio-temporal data","Visual analytics;Rivers;Bridges;Social network services;Tools;Hospitals","computational complexity;data analysis;data visualisation;social networking (online)","social media;movement analysis;story synthesis;complex data;sophisticated algorithmic techniques;visual techniques;interactive techniques;visual analytics expertise;analysis outcomes;visual analytics systems;analytical visualizations;target audiences;multiple heterogeneous facets;analysis findings;information complexity;display complexity;data analysis;result presentation;story contents;analytic findings;data constructs;assembling organizing findings;tracking analysis history;data displays","","20","","70","IEEE","21 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The limitations observed in these approaches motivate us to collaborate with domain experts and propose a visual analytics solution for the performance analysis and incremental planning of bus routes based on an existing bus network. Developing such a solution involves three major challenges, namely, a) the in-depth analysis of complex bus route networks, b) the interactive generation of improved route candidates, and c) the effective evaluation of alternative bus routes. For challenge a, we employ an overview-to-detail approach by dividing the analysis of a complex bus network into three levels to facilitate the efficient identification of deficient routes. For challenge b, we improve a route generation model and interpret the performance of the generation with tailored visualizations. For challenge c, we incorporate a conflict resolution strategy in the progressive decision-making process to assist users in evaluating the alternative routes and finding the most optimal one.

In previous studies, paper-reference matrices are usually transformed into reference-reference matrices to obtain co-citation relationships, which are then visualized in different representations, typically as node-link networks, to represent the intellectual structures of scientific domains. Such network visualizations sometimes contain tightly knit components, which make visual analysis of the intellectual structure a challenging task. In this study, we propose a new approach to reveal co-citation relationships. Instead of using a reference-reference matrix, we directly use the original paper-reference matrix as the information source, and transform the paper-reference matrix into an FP-tree and visualize it in a Java-based prototype system. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through visual analyses of the intellectual structure of two domains: information visualization and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The results show that our visualization not only retains the major information of co-citation relationships, but also reveals more detailed sub-structures of tightly knit clusters than a conventional node-link network visualization.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2009.202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290724","Intellectual Structure;Paper-reference Matrix;FP-tree;Co-citation","Data visualization;Information analysis;Prototypes;Java;Tree data structures;Chaos;Joining processes;Testing;Libraries;Information science","astronomical surveys;astronomy computing;citation analysis;data visualisation;Java;network theory (graphs);pattern clustering;scientific information systems;trees (mathematics)","intellectual structure visualization;paper-reference matrix;scientific domain analysis;co-cited unit;reference analysis;author analysis;reference-reference matrix;co-citation relationship;node-link network visualization;visual analysis;information source;FP-tree;Java-based prototype system;information visualization;Sloan Digital Sky Survey;SDSS;tightly-knit cluster","","20","","35","","23 Oct 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The neural activity resulting from viewing flow visualizations is simulated and evaluated to produce a metric of visualization effectiveness. Visualization optimization is achieved by applying this effectiveness metric as the utility function in a hill-climbing algorithm. We apply this method to the evaluation and optimization of 2D flow visualizations, using two visualization parameterizations: streaklet-based and pixel-based. An emergent property of the streaklet-based optimization is head-to-tail streaklet alignment. It had been previously hypothesized the effectiveness of head-to-tail alignment results from the perceptual processing of the visual system, but this theory had not been computationally modeled. A second optimization using a pixel-based parameterization resulted in a LIC-like result. The implications in terms of the selection of primitives is discussed. We argue that computational models can be used for optimizing complex visualizations. In addition, we argue that they can provide a means of computationally evaluating perceptual theories of visualization, and as a method for quality control of display methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.52","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5728805","Information visualization;perception;human information processing;neural nets;optimization.","Data visualization;Computational modeling;Visualization;Neurons;Retina;Image color analysis;Data models","biology computing;data visualisation;digital simulation;eye;neural nets;visual perception","data visualization optimization;perception computational modeling;human vision computational model;neural network simulation;retina;primary visual cortex;hill-climbing algorithm;2D flow visualizations;streaklet-based optimization;head-to-tail streaklet alignment;pixel-based parameterization;LIC-like result","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Humans;Models, Neurological;Nerve Net;Retina;Visual Cortex;Visual Perception","19","","38","IEEE","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We define an expanded space of axis labelings by automatically generating additional nice numbers as needed and by permitting the extreme labels to occur inside the data range. These changes provide flexibility in problematic cases, without degrading quality elsewhere. We also propose an additional optimization criterion, legibility, which allows us to simultaneously optimize over label formatting, font size, and orientation. To solve this revised optimization problem, we describe the optimization function and an efficient search algorithm. Finally, we compare our method to previous work using both quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Our implementation is fast and effective for contour tree sizes usually used in interactive systems (around 100 branches) and also produces readable pictures for larger trees, as is shown for an 800 branch example.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5674034","Contour tree;graph layout.","Layout;Stress;Visualization;Image edge detection;Isosurfaces;Minimization;Clustering algorithms","computational geometry;data visualisation;interactive systems;trees (mathematics)","contour tree compactly;scalar field topology;graph drawing;interactive systems","","18","","40","","23 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the CC lattices lead to suboptimal representation of the simulation space. We introduce the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, fD3Q13, for LBM simulations. Compared to the CC lattices, the fD3Q13 lattice creates a more isotropic sampling of the simulation domain and its single lattice speed (i.e., link length) simplifies the computations and data storage. Furthermore, the fD3Q13 lattice can be decomposed into two independent interleaved lattices, one of which can be discarded, which doubles the simulation speed. The resulting LBM simulation can be efficiently mapped to the GPU, further increasing the computational performance. We show the numerical advantages of the FCC lattice on channeled flow in 2D and the flow-past-a-sphere benchmark in 3D. In both cases, the comparison is against the corresponding CC lattices using the analytical solutions for the systems as well as velocity field visualizations.

How to visually reveal patterns of a network over a tree has not been fully studied. In this paper, we propose a compound graph model, TreeNet, to support visualization and analysis of a network at multiple levels of aggregation over a tree. We also present a visualization design, TreeNetViz, to offer the multiscale and cross-scale exploration and interaction of a TreeNet graph. TreeNetViz uses a Radial, Space-Filling (RSF) visualization to represent the tree structure, a circle layout with novel optimization to show aggregated networks derived from TreeNet, and an edge bundling technique to reduce visual complexity. Our circular layout algorithm reduces both total edge-crossings and edge length and also considers hierarchical structure constraints and edge weight in a TreeNet graph. These experiments illustrate that the algorithm can reduce visual cluttering in TreeNet graphs. Our case study also shows that TreeNetViz has the potential to support the analysis of a compound graph by revealing multiscale and cross-scale network patterns.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065012","Compound graph;network and tree;TreeNetViz;visualization;multiscale and cross-scale.","Graphics;Tree data structures;Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Data visualization","computational complexity;data visualisation;graph theory;optimisation;tree data structures","TreeNetViz;networks patterns;tree structures;network data;social network;social affiliations;expertise areas;compound graph model;TreeNet graph;radial space filling visualization;circle layout;optimization;visual complexity;visual cluttering","","18","","42","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Each graph of a sequence is visualized by an adjacency matrix, where the hierarchical group structure is encoded within the matrix using indentation and nested contours, complemented by icicle plots attached to the matrices. The density within and between subgroups of the hierarchy is represented within the matrices using a gray scale. To visualize changes, transitions and dissimilarities between the hierarchically structured graphs are shown using a flow metaphor and color coding. The design of our visualization technique allows us to show more than one hierarchical group structure of the same graph by stacking the sequences, where hierarchy comparison is supported not only within but also between sequences.

However, streamgraph as well as ThemeRiver suffer from scalability problems when dealing with several time series. To solve this problem, multiple time series can be organized into a hierarchical structure where individual time series are grouped hierarchically according to their proximity. In this paper, we present a new streamgraph-based approach to convey the hierarchical structure of multiple time series to facilitate the exploration and comparisons of temporal evolution.

Key to the simplicity and efficiency of the algorithm is an alternate definition of the Reeb graph that considers equivalence classes of level sets instead of individual level sets. The algorithm works in two steps. The first step locates all critical points of the function in the domain. Critical points correspond to nodes in the Reeb graph. Arcs connecting the nodes are computed in the second step by a simple search procedure that works on a small subset of the domain that corresponds to a pair of critical points. The paper also describes a scheme for controlled simplification of the Reeb graph and two different graph layout schemes that help in the effective presentation of Reeb graphs for visual analysis of scalar fields.

Recent research has shown that such problems can be approached by learning a natural motion manifold using deep learning on a large amount data, to address the shortcomings of traditional data-driven approaches. However, previous deep learning methods can be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, the skeletal information has not been fully utilized for feature extraction. Unlike images, it is difficult to define spatial proximity in skeletal motions in the way that deep networks can be applied for feature extraction. Second, motion is time-series data with strong multi-modal temporal correlations between frames. On the one hand, a frame could be followed by several candidate frames leading to different motions; on the other hand, long-range dependencies exist where a number of frames in the beginning are correlated with a number of frames later. Ineffective temporal modeling would either under-estimate the multi-modality and variance, resulting in featureless mean motion or over-estimate them resulting in jittery motions, which is a major source of visual artifacts. In this paper, we propose a new deep network to tackle these challenges by creating a natural motion manifold that is versatile for many applications. The network has a new spatial component for feature extraction. It is also equipped with a new batch prediction model that predicts a large number of frames at once, such that long-term temporally-based objective functions can be employed to correctly learn the motion multi-modality and variances. With our system, long-duration motions can be predicted/synthesized using an open-loop setup where the motion retains the dynamics accurately. It can also be used for denoising corrupted motions and synthesizing new motions with given control signals. We demonstrate that our system can create superior results comparing to existing work in multiple applications.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2936810","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/R031193/1); Nvidia; Royal Society(grant numbers:IES\R2\181024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809754","Computer graphics;computer animation;character animation;deep learning","Manifolds;Deep learning;Skeleton;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Dynamics;Animation","computer graphics;computer vision;feature extraction;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;time series","skeletal information;feature extraction;skeletal motions;deep network;time-series data;featureless mean motion;natural motion manifold;batch prediction model;motion multimodality;spatio-temporal manifold learning;human motions;long-horizon modeling;data-driven modeling;computer graphics;computer vision;corrupted motion denoising;open-loop setup;deep learning","Computer Graphics;Deep Learning;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Movement;Video Recording","17","","53","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the continuous optimization step, we iteratively partition the base surface into approximate Voronoi regions of the tiles and optimize the positions and orientations of the tiles to achieve a tight fit.

They have a large number of application areas ranging from statistical data analysis to software engineering. However, the automated generation of Euler diagrams has never been easy: given an abstract description of a required Euler diagram, it is computationally expensive to generate the diagram. Moreover, the generated diagrams represent sets by polygons, sometimes with quite irregular shapes that make the diagrams less comprehensible. In this paper, we address these two issues by developing the theory of piercings, where we define single piercing curves and double piercing curves. We prove that if a diagram can be built inductively by successively adding piercing curves under certain constraints, then it can be drawn with circles, which are more esthetically pleasing than arbitrary polygons. The theory of piercings is developed at the abstract level. In addition, we present a Java implementation that, given an inductively pierced abstract description, generates an Euler diagram consisting only of circles within polynomial time.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582085","Automated diagram drawing;Euler diagrams;diagrammatic reasoning;information visualization.","Software;Polynomials;Layout;Visualization;Measurement;Ontologies;Shape","computational geometry;data visualisation;Java;polynomials","Euler diagrams;circles;piercings theory;set intersection visualization;statistical data analysis;software engineering;single piercing curves;double piercing curves;arbitrary polygons;Java implementation;polynomial time","","16","","27","IEEE","23 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine graph spectral processing approach that exploits the fact that the sharp features reside in a low dimensional structure hidden in the noisy 3D dataset. In the coarse step, the mesh is processed in parts, using a model based Bayesian learning method that identifies the noise level in each part and the subspace where the features lie. In the feature-aware fine step, we iteratively smooth face normals and vertices, while preserving geometric features.

First, we propose a constrained random walks algorithm that can add constraints to the random walks procedure and thus allows for a variety of intuitive user inputs. Second, we design an optimization process that uses the shortest graph path to derive a nice cut contour. Then a new mesh cutting algorithm is developed based on the constrained random walks plus the optimization process. Within the same computational framework, the new algorithm provides a novel user interface for interactive mesh cutting that supports three typical user inputs and also their combinations: 1) foreground/background seed inputs: the user draws strokes specifying seeds for “foreground” (i.e., the part to be cut out) and “background” (i.e., the rest); 2) soft constraint inputs: the user draws strokes on the mesh indicating the region which the cuts should be made nearby; and 3) hard constraint inputs: the marks which the cutting contour must pass. The algorithm uses feature sensitive metrics that are based on surface geometric properties and cognitive theory. The integration of the constrained random walks algorithm, the optimization process, the feature sensitive metrics, and the varieties of user inputs makes the algorithm intuitive, flexible, and effective as well. The experimental examples show that the proposed cutting method is fast, reliable, and capable of producing good results reflecting user intention and geometric attributes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2010.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453359","Computational geometry and object modeling;interaction techniques;geometric algorithms.","Shape;Humans;Constraint optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Process design;Design optimization;Computer interfaces;User interfaces;Geometry;Solid modeling","computational geometry;constraint handling;graph theory;mesh generation;optimisation","constrained random walks;optimization process;graph path;interactive mesh cutting;user interface;cognitive theory;surface geometric properties","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;User-Computer Interface","16","2","36","","22 Apr 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This kind of set-based analysis has various applications in a variety of domains, due to the generic and powerful notion of sets. However, visualizing intersections relations is challenging because their number grows exponentially with the number of sets. We present a novel technique based on Treemaps to provide a comprehensive overview of non-empty intersections in a set system in a scalable way.

However, the analysis of this type of data remains a challenge. One issue is the robust selection of neighborhoods − a crucial part of analytic tools such as topological decomposition, clustering and gradient estimation. When extracting the topology of sparsely sampled data, common neighborhood strategies such as k-nearest neighbors may lead to inaccurate results, either due to missing neighborhood connections, which introduce false extrema, or due to spurious connections, which conceal true extrema. Other neighborhoods, such as the Delaunay triangulation, are costly to compute and store even in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, we address these issues. We present two new types of neighborhood graphs: a variation on and a generalization of empty region graphs, which considerably improve the robustness of neighborhood-based analysis tools, such as topological decomposition. Our findings suggest that these neighborhood graphs lead to more accurate topological representations of low- and high- dimensional data sets at relatively low cost, both in terms of storage and computation time. We describe the implications of our work in the analysis and visualization of scalar functions, and provide general strategies for computing and applying our neighborhood graphs towards robust data analysis.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064948","Neighborhood graphs;topology;sparsely sampled data.","Topology;Robustness;Data mining;Noise measurement","data analysis;data visualisation;gradient methods;graph theory;mesh generation;pattern clustering;sampling methods;set theory","sparsely sampled data;sparse irregular sampling;high dimensional signal;topological decomposition;topological clustering;gradient estimation;neighborhood strategy;k-nearest neighbor;neighborhood connection;spurious connection;Delaunay triangulation;empty region graph;neighborhood-based analysis tool;topological decomposition;neighborhood graph;high dimensional data set;low dimensional data set;scalar function visualization;robust data analysis","","15","","54","IEEE","3 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although the existence and properties of closed geodesics on smooth surfaces have been widely studied in mathematics community, relatively little progress has been made on how to compute them on polygonal surfaces. Most existing algorithms simply consider the mesh as a graph and so the resultant loops are restricted only on mesh edges, which are far from the actual geodesics. This paper is the first to prove the existence and uniqueness of geodesic loop restricted on a closed face sequence; it contributes also with an efficient algorithm to iteratively evolve an initial closed path on a given mesh into an exact geodesic loop within finite steps. Our proposed algorithm takes only an O(k) space complexity and an O(mk) time complexity (experimentally), where m is the number of vertices in the region bounded by the initial loop and the resultant geodesic loop, and k is the average number of edges in the edge sequences that the evolving loop passes through. In contrast to the existing geodesic curvature flow methods which compute an approximate geodesic loop within a predefined threshold, our method is exact and can apply directly to triangular meshes without needing to solve any differential equation with a numerical solver; it can run at interactive speed, e.g., in the order of milliseconds, for a mesh with around 50K vertices, and hence, significantly outperforms existing algorithms. Actually, our algorithm could run at interactive speed even for larger meshes. Besides the complexity of the input mesh, the geometric shape could also affect the number of evolving steps, i.e., the performance. We motivate our algorithm with an interactive shape segmentation example shown later in the paper.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2011.119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5928345","Discrete geodesic;geodesic loop;triangular mesh.","Face;Shape;Approximation algorithms;Image edge detection;Complexity theory;Measurement;Approximation methods","computational complexity;computational geometry;differential geometry;image segmentation;mesh generation","differential topology;differential geometry;mathematics community;polygonal surfaces;closed face sequence;closed path;exact geodesic loop;finite steps;space complexity;time complexity;edge sequences;geodesic curvature flow method;triangular mesh edge;interactive speed;geometric shape;interactive shape segmentation","","14","","38","IEEE","23 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The tree is laid out linearly, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, restructure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes.

Based on well-known results in shape analysis, we propose a scagnostics approach that captures both scatterplot shape and orientation using skeletons (or medial axes).

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies.

We generalize existing occlusion culling algorithms, intended for static scenes, to handle dynamic scenes having numerous moving objects. The data structure used by an occlusion culling method is updated to reflect the objects' possible positions. To avoid updating the structure for every dynamic object at each frame, a temporal bounding volume (TBV) is created for each occluded dynamic object, using some known constraints on the object's motion. The TBV is inserted into the structure instead of the object. Subsequently, the object is ignored as long as the TBV is occluded and guaranteed to contain the object. The generalized algorithms' rendering time is linearly affected only by the scene's visible parts, not by hidden parts or by occluded dynamic objects. Our techniques also save communications in distributed graphic systems, e.g., multiuser virtual environments, by eliminating update messages for hidden dynamic objects.

From this data, many people might confidently state that a before-school breakfast program would lead to higher grades. This is a reasoning error, because correlation does not necessarily indicate causation - X and Y can be correlated without one directly causing the other. While this error is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way that the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments, we examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this reasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the breakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link. We asked participants to rate their level of agreement that the relation was correlated, which they rated appropriately as high. However, participants also expressed high agreement with a causal interpretation of the data. Levels of support for the causal interpretation were not equally strong across visualization types: causality ratings were highest for text descriptions and bar graphs, but weaker for scatter plots. But is this effect driven by bar graphs aggregating data into two groups or by the visual encoding type? We isolated data aggregation versus visual encoding type and examined their individual effect on perceived causality. Overall, different visualization designs afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data. High levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher perceived causality in data. Participants perceived line and dot visual encodings as more causal than bar encodings. Our results demonstrate how some visualization designs trigger stronger causal links while choosing others can help mitigate unwarranted perceptions of causality.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805448","Information Visualization;Correlation and Causation;Visualization Design;Reasoning Affordance","Correlation;Data visualization;Bars;Task analysis;Visualization;Cognition;Encoding","causality;cognition;data visualisation;educational computing;educational institutions;graph theory","causal interpretation;visualization types;causality ratings;bar graphs;data aggregation;bar encodings;data visualization;grade point average;before-school breakfast program;crowdsourced experiments;text descriptions","","13","","50","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, reflections and refractions of environment maps and nearby geometry can be rendered on a GPU interactively without preprocessing. We can even achieve interactive recursive reflections and refractions by using an object-impostor technique.

Our framework, called Persistence Atlas, enables the visualization of the dominant spatial patterns of critical points, along with statistics regarding their occurrence in the ensemble. The persistence atlas represents in the geometrical domain each dominant pattern in the form of a confidence map for the appearance of critical points. As a by-product, our method also provides 2-dimensional layouts of the entire ensemble, highlighting the main trends at a global level. Our approach is based on the new notion of Persistence Map, a measure of the geometrical density in critical points which leverages the robustness to noise of topological persistence to better emphasize salient features. We show how to leverage spectral embedding to represent the ensemble members as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, where distances between points measure the dissimilarities between critical point layouts and where statistical tasks, such as clustering, can be easily carried out. Further, we show how the notion of mandatory critical point can be leveraged to evaluate for each cluster confidence regions for the appearance of critical points. Most of the steps of this framework can be trivially parallelized and we show how to efficiently implement them. Extensive experiments demonstrate the relevance of our approach. The accuracy of the confidence regions provided by the persistence atlas is quantitatively evaluated and compared to a baseline strategy using an off-the-shelf clustering approach. We illustrate the importance of the persistence atlas in a variety of real-life datasets, where clear trends in feature layouts are identified and analyzed.

First, we design a deep saliency network with guided non-local blocks (GNLBs) for learning long-range pixel dependencies by taking the predicted saliency map at former layer as the guidance image to help suppress the non-saliency regions in the shallow layer. The GNLB computes the saliency response at a position by a weighted sum of features at all positions, and enables us to produce results that outperform existing deep saliency models. Second, we formulate a joint optimization framework to take saliency information when iteratively separating textures from structures: on the texture layer, we smooth out structures with the help of the saliency information and migrate structures from the texture to structure layer, while on the structure layer, we adopt another deep model to detect edges and simultaneous sparse coding to push textures back to the texture layer.

Existing methods attempt to achieve several shared optimization goals, such as reducing empty space and minimizing line crossings and wiggles. However, these goals do not always produce optimal results when compared to hand-drawn storylines. We conducted a preliminary study to learn how users translate a narrative into a hand-drawn storyline and check whether the visual elements in hand-drawn illustrations can be mapped back to appropriate narrative contexts. We also compared the hand-drawn storylines with storylines generated by the state-of-the-art methods and found they have significant differences. Our findings led to a design space that summarizes 1) how artists utilize narrative elements and 2) the sequence of actions artists follow to portray expressive and attractive storylines. We developed iStoryline, an authoring tool for integrating high-level user interactions into optimization algorithms and achieving a balance between hand-drawn storylines and automatic layouts. iStoryline allows users to create novel storyline visualizations easily according to their preferences by modifying the automatically generated layouts.

The basic idea is deforming a road network to meet a user-specified mental map while an optimization process is performed to propagate distortions originating from road network warping. To generate a map, the proposed method includes algorithms for estimating road significance and for deforming a road network according to various geometric and aesthetic constraints. The proposed method can produce an iconic mark of a theme from a road network and meet a user-specified mental map. Therefore, the resulting map can serve as a tourist or destination map that not only provides visual aids for route planning and navigation tasks, but also visually emphasizes the presentation of a theme in a map for the purpose of advertising.

In general, there is no single optimal sparse data structure, but a set of several candidates with individual strengths and drawbacks. One solution to this problem are hybrid data structures which locally adapt themselves to the sparsity. However, they typically suffer from increased traversal overhead which limits their utility in many applications. This paper presents JiTTree, a novel sparse hybrid volume data structure that uses just-in-time compilation to overcome these problems. By combining multiple sparse data structures and reducing traversal overhead we leverage their individual advantages. We demonstrate that hybrid data structures adapt well to a large range of data sets. They are especially superior to other sparse data structures for data sets that locally vary in sparsity. Possible optimization criteria are memory, performance and a combination thereof. Through just-in-time (JIT) compilation, JiTTree reduces the traversal overhead of the resulting optimal data structure. As a result, our hybrid volume data structure enables efficient computations on the GPU, while being superior in terms of memory usage when compared to non-hybrid data structures.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467331","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) Visual Computing Center, and the ViMaL(grant numbers:P21695); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192686","Data Transformation and Representation;GPUs and Multi-core Architectures;Volume Rendering;Data Transformation and Representation;GPUs and Multi-core Architectures;Volume Rendering","Octrees;Graphics processing units;Arrays;Memory management;Optimization;Layout","data structures;graphics processing units;just-in-time;optimisation","memory usage;traversal overhead;optimization criteria;data access patterns;memory budget;GPU memory;just-in-time compiled sparse GPU volume data structure;JiTTree","","11","","30","IEEE","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We explain our approach using the example of efficient retrieval of demographic analyses by Hans Rosling and discuss our implementation for a fast look-up of previous states.

However, working with human motion tracking data to support such analysis poses great challenges. In this paper, we propose MotionFlow, a visual analytics system that provides an effective overview of various motion patterns based on an interactive flow visualization. This visualization formulates a motion sequence as transitions between static poses, and aggregates these sequences into a tree diagram to construct a set of motion patterns. The system also allows the users to directly reflect the context of data and their perception of pose similarities in generating representative pose states. We provide local and global controls over the partition-based clustering process. To support the users in organizing unstructured motion data into pattern groups, we designed a set of interactions that enables searching for similar motion sequences from the data, detailed exploration of data subsets, and creating and modifying the group of motion patterns. To evaluate the usability of MotionFlow, we conducted a user study with six researchers with expertise in gesture-based interaction design. They used MotionFlow to explore and organize unstructured motion tracking data. Results show that the researchers were able to easily learn how to use MotionFlow, and the system effectively supported their pattern analysis activities, including leveraging their perception and domain knowledge.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2468292","Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation(grant numbers:1235232); CPS(grant numbers:1329979); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194831","Human motion visualization;interactive clustering;motion tracking data;expert reviews;user study;Human motion visualization;interactive clustering;motion tracking data;expert reviews;user study","Data visualization;Tracking;Pattern analysis;Visualization;Context;Layout;Three-dimensional displays","data visualisation;gesture recognition;human computer interaction;interactive systems;object tracking;pattern clustering;pose estimation;trees (mathematics)","MotionFlow;visual abstraction;sequential pattern aggregation;human motion tracking data;human motion pattern analysis;visual analytics system;interactive flow visualization;motion sequence;static pose;tree diagram;pose similarity;representative pose state;partition-based clustering process;unstructured motion data organization;pattern groups;data subset exploration;gesture-based interaction design","Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Movement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Video Recording","11","3","46","IEEE","13 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the extracted skeleton within the treelike object, a radial planar embedding is first obtained such that there are no self-intersections of the skeleton which would have resulted in occlusions in the final view. An optimization procedure which adjusts the angular positions of the skeleton nodes is then used to reconstruct the shape as closely as possible to the original, according to a specified view plane, which thus preserves the global geometric context of the object. Using this shape recovered embedded skeleton, the object surface is then flattened to the plane without occlusions using harmonic mapping. The boundary of the mesh is adjusted during the flattening step to account for regions where the mesh is stretched over concavities. This parameterized surface can then be used either as a map for guidance during endoluminal navigation or directly for interrogation and decision making. Depth cues are provided with a grayscale border to aid in shape understanding.

In contrast, the bar graph is more effective in showing the frequency/interval, but less effective in showing an overall pattern than the line graph. We integrate the line graph and bar graph in a unified visualization model, called a ripple graph, to take the benefits of both of them with enhanced graphical integrity. Based on the ripple graph, we implemented an interactive time-series data visualization tool, called Stroscope, which facilitates multi-scale visualizations by providing users with a graphical widget to interactively control the integrated visualization model. We evaluated the visualization model (i.e., the ripple graph) through a controlled user study and Stroscope through long-term case studies with neurologists exploring large blood pressure measurement data of stroke patients.

The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns.

In this paper, we systematically study the extraction, representation,exploration, and visualization of spatial relations in volumetric data and propose a novel relation-aware visualization pipeline for volume exploration. In our pipeline, various relations in the volume are first defined and measured using region connection calculus (RCC) and then represented using a graph interface called relation graph. With RCC and the relation graph, relation query and interactive exploration can be conducted in a comprehensive and intuitive way. The visualization process is further assisted with relation-revealing viewpoint selection and color and opacity enhancement.

Multigrid solvers show excellent convergence in simple scenarios, yet they can converge slowly in domains where physically separated regions are combined at coarser scales. Moreover, existing multigrid solvers are tailored to specific discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation, and they cannot easily be adapted to other discretizations. In this paper we analyze the convergence properties of existing multigrid solvers for the pressure Poisson equation in different simulation domains, and we show how to further improve the multigrid convergence rate by using a graph-based extension to determine the coarse grid hierarchy. The proposed multigrid solver is generic in that it can be applied to different kinds of discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation, by using solely the specification of the simulation domain and pre-assembled computational stencils. We analyze the proposed solver in combination with finite difference and finite volume discretizations of the pressure Poisson equation. Our evaluations show that, despite the common assumption, multigrid schemes can exploit their potential even in the most complicated simulation scenarios, yet this behavior is obtained at the price of higher memory consumption.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2511734","European Union; ERC(grant numbers:291372); Safer-Vis—Uncertainty Visualization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7364293","Fluid simulation;multigrid;convergence analysis","Mathematical model;Convergence;Computational modeling;Multigrid methods;Interpolation;Poisson equations;Topology","computational fluid dynamics;convergence of numerical methods;finite difference methods;finite volume methods;flow simulation;graph theory;Navier-Stokes equations;Poisson equation","fluid pressure Poisson equation;numerical simulations;incompressible Navier-Stokes equations;mass conservation;simulation domains;multigrid convergence rate improvement;graph-based extension;coarse grid hierarchy;generic multigrid solver;preassembled computational stencils;finite difference discretizations;finite volume discretizations","","10","","27","IEEE","23 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This process can be difficult and time consuming for professional designers, not to mention non-expert users, leading to the demand for automated infographics design. As a first step, we focus on timeline infographics, which have been widely used for centuries. We contribute an end-to-end approach that automatically extracts an extensible timeline template from a bitmap image. Our approach adopts a deconstruction and reconstruction paradigm. At the deconstruction stage, we propose a multi-task deep neural network that simultaneously parses two kinds of information from a bitmap timeline: 1) the global information, i.e., the representation, scale, layout, and orientation of the timeline, and 2) the local information, i.e., the location, category, and pixels of each visual element on the timeline. At the reconstruction stage, we propose a pipeline with three techniques, i.e., Non-Maximum Merging, Redundancy Recover, and DL GrabCut, to extract an extensible template from the infographic, by utilizing the deconstruction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesize a timeline dataset (4296 images) and collect a real-world timeline dataset (393 images) from the Internet.

Finding a “good” layout of a graph is thus an important task for graph visualization. In practice, users often visualize a graph in multiple layouts by using different methods and varying parameter settings until they find a layout that best suits the purpose of the visualization. However, this trial-and-error process is often haphazard and time-consuming. To provide users with an intuitive way to navigate the layout design space, we present a technique to systematically visualize a graph in diverse layouts using deep generative models. We design an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a model from a collection of example layouts, where the encoder represents training examples in a latent space and the decoder produces layouts from the latent space. In particular, we train the model to construct a two-dimensional latent space for users to easily explore and generate various layouts. We demonstrate our approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated layouts. The results of our evaluations show that our model is capable of learning and generalizing abstract concepts of graph layouts, not just memorizing the training examples. In summary, this paper presents a fundamentally new approach to graph visualization where a machine learning model learns to visualize a graph from examples without manually-defined heuristics.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934396","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1741536); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805452","Graph;network;visualization;layout;machine learning;deep learning;neural network;generative model;autoencoder","Layout;Training;Visualization;Task analysis;Data visualization;Machine learning;Data models","data visualisation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;neural nets","graph visualization;diverse layouts;deep generative model;encoder-decoder architecture;two-dimensional latent space;graph layouts;machine learning model","","9","","87","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This trial and error process is often tedious and time-consuming, especially for non-expert users. Inspired by the powerful data modelling and prediction capabilities of deep learning techniques, we explore the possibility of applying deep learning techniques to graph drawing. Specifically, we propose using a graph-LSTM-based approach to directly map network structures to graph drawings. Given a set of layout examples as the training dataset, we train the proposed graph-LSTM-based model to capture their layout characteristics. Then, the trained model is used to generate graph drawings in a similar style for new networks. We evaluated the proposed approach on two special types of layouts (i.e., grid layouts and star layouts) and two general types of layouts (i.e., ForceAtlas2 and PivotMDS) in both qualitative and quantitative ways. The results provide support for the effectiveness of our approach. We also conducted a time cost assessment on the drawings of small graphs with 20 to 50 nodes.

Thus, we present PieceStack in this paper, to reveal the relevance of stacked graphs in understanding intrinsic details of their displayed shapes. This new visual analytic design interprets the ways through which aggregations are generated with individual layers by interactively splitting and re-constructing the stacked graphs. A clustering algorithm is designed to partition stacked graphs into sub-aggregated pieces based on trend similarities of layers.

Existing visualization approaches for such data include animated 2D treemaps, where the dynamically changing layout makes it difficult to observe the data in its entirety. We present a method to visualize this dynamic data in a static, nested, and space-filling visualization. This is based on two major contributions: First, the layout constitutes a graph drawing problem. We approach it for the entire time span at once using a combination of a heuristic and simulated annealing.

To gain insight into such relationships, their corresponding graph can be visualized. In the past, many classes of graphs have been defined, e.g. trees, planar graphs, directed acyclic graphs, and visualization algorithms were proposed for these classes. Although many graphs may only be classified as ""general"" graphs, they can contain substructures that belong to a certain class. Archambault proposed the TopoLayout framework: rather than draw any arbitrary graph using one method, split the graph into components that are homogeneous with respect to one graph class and then draw each component with an algorithm best suited for this class. Graph products constitute a class that arises frequently in graph theory, but for which no visualization algorithm has been proposed until now. In this paper, we present an algorithm for drawing graph products and the aesthetic criterion graph product's drawings are subject to. We show that the popular High-Dimensional Embedder approach applied to cartesian products already respects this aestetic criterion, but has disadvantages. We also present how our method is integrated as a new component into the TopoLayout framework.

In scalar field topology, graph-based topological descriptors such as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are commonly used to characterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields. One of the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based visualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such topological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In this paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and use it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree that minimizes its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a well-defined metric called the interleaving distance. We provide heuristic strategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose labels do not fully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that resembles a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and outputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural similarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty information for visual exploration. We develop a novel measure of uncertainty, referred to as consistency, via a metric-space view of the input trees. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our framework through merge trees that arise from ensembles of scalar fields. Our work is the first to employ interleaving distances and consistency to study a global, mathematically rigorous, structural average of merge trees in the context of uncertainty visualization.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934242","NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1740761,CCF-1907591,CMMI-1562012,DBI-1661375,IIS-1513616,RI-1815697,DMS-1547357); NIH(grant numbers:R01EB022899,1R01EB022876); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794553","Topological data analysis;uncertainty visualization;merge trees","Uncertainty;Data visualization;Vegetation;Topology;Visualization;Measurement uncertainty","computational geometry;data analysis;data visualisation;interactive systems;trees (mathematics)","structural average;labeled merge trees;uncertainty visualization;scalar field topology;graph-based topological descriptors;topology-based visualization;1-center tree;interleaving distance;interactive visualization system;topological data analysis;topological data visualization","","8","","81","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Not only are other encodings less precise than position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). By comparison, position's high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. In contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a short delay. In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of average positions were significantly biased, such that line positions were underestimated and bar positions were overestimated. In displays with multiple data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias still persisted. We also observed an effect of “perceptual pull”, where the average position estimate for each series was `pulled' toward the other. These findings suggest that, although position may still be the most precise form of visual data encoding, it can also be systematically biased.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805427","Perceptual biases;perception and cognition;cue combination;bar graphs;line graphs;position estimation","Bars;Data visualization;Visualization;Encoding;Systematics;Image color analysis;Task analysis","data visualisation;estimation theory;graph theory;image colour analysis","multiple data series;systematic bias;perceptual pull;visual data encoding;bar graphs;overestimation;color category boundaries;line positions;bar positions;biased average position estimation","","8","","34","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As opposed to previous work, we do not solve the resulting linear systems of the maxent-stress metric with a typical numerical solver. Instead we use a simple local iterative scheme within a multilevel approach. To accelerate local optimization, we approximate long-range forces and use shared-memory parallelism. Our experiments validate the high potential of our approach, which is particularly appealing for dynamic graphs.

Highly multiplexed tissue images are complex, comprising 109 or more pixels, 60-plus channels, and millions of individual cells. This makes manual analysis challenging and error-prone. Existing automated approaches are also inadequate, in large part, because they are unable to effectively exploit the deep knowledge of human tissue biology available to anatomic pathologists. To overcome these challenges, Facetto enables a semi-automated analysis of cell types and states. It integrates unsupervised and supervised learning into the image and feature exploration process and offers tools for analytical provenance. Experts can cluster the data to discover new types of cancer and immune cells and use clustering results to train a convolutional neural network that classifies new cells accordingly. Likewise, the output of classifiers can be clustered to discover aggregate patterns and phenotype subsets. We also introduce a new hierarchical approach to keep track of analysis steps and data subsets created by users; this assists in the identification of cell types. Users can build phenotype trees and interact with the resulting hierarchical structures of both high-dimensional feature and image spaces.

Jiang","Nanjing Univ., Nanjing; NA; NA; NA","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","21 Jan 2008","2008","14","2","426","439","This paper presents a novel approach for replacing textures of specified regions in the input image and video using stretch-based mesh optimization. The retexturing results have the similar distortion and shading effect conforming to the unknown underlying geometry and lighting conditions. For replacing textures in a single image, two important steps are developed: The stretch-based mesh parameterization incorporating the recovered normal information is deduced to imitate perspective distortion of the region of interest; the Poisson-based refinement process is exploited to account for texture distortion at fine scale. The luminance of the input image is preserved through color transfer in YCbCr color space. Our approach is independent of the replaced textures. Once the input image is processed, any new textures can be applied to efficiently generate the retexturing results. For video retexturing, we propose key-frame-based texture replacement extended and generalized from the image retexturing. Our approach repeatedly propagates the replacement results of key frames to the rest of the frames. We develop the local motion optimization scheme to deal with the inaccuracies and errors of robust optical flow when tracking moving objects. Visibility shifting and texture drifting are effectively alleviated using graphcut segmentation algorithm and the global optimization to smooth trajectories of the tracked points over temporal domain. Our experimental results showed that the proposed approach can generate visually pleasing results for retextured images and video.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70438","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359506","Picture/Image Generation;Color;shading;shadowing;and texture;Image Processing and Computer Vision;Picture/Image Generation;Color;shading;shadowing;and texture;Image Processing and Computer Vision","Geometry;Surface texture;Image segmentation;Visual effects;Light sources;Data mining;Sun;Mesh generation;Optical propagation;Robustness","graph theory;image colour analysis;image motion analysis;image segmentation;image texture;stochastic processes;video signal processing","mesh-guided optimized retexturing;image textures;video textures;stretch-based mesh optimization;shading effect;underlying geometry;Poisson-based refinement process;color transfer;YCbCr color space;key-frame-based texture replacement;local motion optimization scheme;robust optical flow;moving objects tracking;graphcut segmentation algorithm;smooth trajectories","","8","7","43","","21 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a nonuniform timeslicing approach for dynamic graph visualization. Our goal is to create timeslices of equal visual complexity. To this end, we adapt histogram equalization to create timeslices with a similar number of events, balancing the visual complexity across timeslices and conveying more important details of timeslices with bursting edges.

In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines.

In this paper, we propose a novel visual summarization technique for bipartite graphs based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The method simultaneously groups the two different set of nodes and constructs aggregated bipartite relations with balanced granularity and precision. It addresses the key trade-off that often occurs for visualizing large scale and noisy data: acquiring a clear and uncluttered overview while maximizing the information content in it. We formulate the visual summarization task as a co-clustering problem and propose an efficient algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that can easily scale to large graphs under reasonable interactive time constraints that previous related methods cannot satisfy. The method leads to the opportunity of introducing a visual analytics framework with multiple levels-of-detail to facilitate interactive data exploration. In the framework, we also introduce a compact visual design inspired by adjacency list representation of graphs as the building block for a small multiples display to compare the bipartite relations for different subsets of data. We showcase the applicability and effectiveness of our approach by applying it on synthetic data with ground truth and performing case studies on real-world datasets from two application domains including roll-call vote record analysis and vehicle fault pattern analysis.

In this article, we investigate the use of such architectures for learning the upscaling of a low resolution sampling of an isosurface to a higher resolution, with reconstruction of spatial detail and shading. We introduce a fully convolutional neural network, to learn a latent representation generating smooth, edge-aware depth and normal fields as well as ambient occlusions from a low resolution depth and normal field. By adding a frame-to-frame motion loss into the learning stage, upscaling can consider temporal variations and achieves improved frame-to-frame coherence. We assess the quality of inferred results and compare it to bi-linear and cubic upscaling. We do this for isosurfaces which were never seen during training, and investigate the improvements when the network can train on the same or similar isosurfaces.

In this article, we propose a brand-new solution to this cross-domain expression transfer problem via nonlinear expression embedding and expression domain translation. We first build low-dimensional latent spaces for the human and avatar facial expressions with variational autoencoder. Then we construct correspondences between the two latent spaces guided by geometric and perceptual constraints. Specifically, we design geometric correspondences to reflect geometric matching and utilize a triplet data structure to express users’ perceptual preference of avatar expressions. A user-friendly method is proposed to automatically generate triplets for a system allowing users to easily and efficiently annotate the correspondences. Using both geometric and perceptual correspondences, we trained a network for expression domain translation from human to avatar. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that even nonprofessional users can apply our method to generate high-quality facial expression retargeting results with less time and effort.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3013876","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672481); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2018495); Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2019NB0AB03); Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research Centre, Nanyang Technological University(grant numbers:04INS000518C130); Ministry of Education - Singapore(grant numbers:MoE 2017-T2-1- 076); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9157962","Facial expression retargeting;variational autoencoder;deformation transfer;cross domain translation;triplet","Avatars;Three-dimensional displays;Strain;Animation;Shape;Solid modeling;Machine learning","avatars;computer animation;data structures;face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing","expression domain translation;low-dimensional latent spaces;human expressions;avatar facial expressions;geometric constraints;perceptual constraints;design geometric correspondences;users;avatar expressions;user-friendly method;perceptual correspondences;high-quality facial expression;facial expression retargeting;avatar made easy;human faces;avatar faces;tedious 3D modeling process;modelers;cross-domain expression transfer problem;nonlinear expression embedding","Computer Graphics;Facial Expression;Humans;User-Computer Interface","7","","52","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Projections with low discriminative ability can adversely influence the final 3D shape representation. Especially under the real situations with background clutter and object occlusion, the adverse effect is even more severe. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel deep neural network, View Discerning Network, which learns to judge the quality of views and adjust their contributions to the representation of shapes. In this network, a Score Generation Unit is devised to evaluate the quality of each projected image with score vectors. These score vectors are used to weight the image features and the weighted features perform much better than original features in 3D shape recognition task. In particular, we introduce two structures of Score Generation Unit, Channel-wise Score Unit and Part-wise Score Unit, to assess the quality of feature maps from different perspectives. Our network aggregates features and scores in an end-to-end framework, so that final shape descriptors are directly obtained from its output. Our experiments on ModelNet and ShapeNet Core55 show that View Discerning Network outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of the retrieval task, with excellent robustness against background clutter and object occlusion.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865317","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61472023,61532003,61572507,61622212); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4182034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8439008","View-based 3D shape recognition;convolutional neural network;image quality judgment","Shape;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Clutter;Solid modeling","clutter;feature extraction;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;shape recognition","final 3D shape representation;discriminative visual representation;view-based 3D shape recognition;View Discerning networks;discriminative 3D shape representations;background clutter;final shape descriptors;network aggregates features;Part-wise Score Unit;Channel-wise Score Unit;3D shape recognition task;weighted features;image features;score vectors;projected image;Score Generation Unit;View Discerning Network;deep neural network;object occlusion","","7","","46","IEEE","17 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, these models neglect fabric mechanics: when a piece of cloth interacts with the environment, its yarn and fiber arrangement usually changes in response to external contact and tension forces. Since subtle changes of a fabric's microstructures can greatly affect its macroscopic appearance, mechanics-driven appearance variation of fabrics has been a phenomenon that remains to be captured. We introduce a mechanics-aware model that adapts the microstructures of cloth yarns in a physics-based manner. Our technique works on two distinct physical scales: using physics-based simulations of individual yarns, we capture the rearrangement of yarn-level structures in response to external forces. These yarn structures are further enriched to obtain appearance-driving fiber-level details. The cross-scale enrichment is made practical through a new parameter fitting algorithm for simulation, an augmented procedural yarn model coupled with a custom-design regression neural network. We train the network using a dataset generated by joint simulations at both the yarn and the fiber levels. Through several examples, we demonstrate that our model is capable of synthesizing photorealistic cloth appearance in a mechanically plausible way.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2937301","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1453101,1717178,1813553); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812922","Cloth appearance;cloth mechanics","Yarn;Fabrics;Computational modeling;Microstructure;Training;Geometry;Neural networks","clothing;clothing industry;fabrics;mechanical contact;neural nets;production engineering computing;regression analysis;rendering (computer graphics);yarn","mechanics-aware modeling;cloth rendering;fiber arrangement;external contact;tension forces;cloth yarn microstructures;physics-based simulations;cross-scale enrichment;photorealistic cloth appearance;fabric mechanics;parameter fitting algorithm;custom-design regression neural network;joint simulations","","7","","36","IEEE","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, no edge concentration method with the explicit purpose of minimizing the number of edges has previously been studied. In this study, we propose a novel, efficient heuristic method for minimizing the number of edges during edge concentration. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method via a comparison using randomly generated graphs. We find that Newbery's method fails to reduce the number of edges when the number of vertices is large.

Previous works of this topic consider pure static scenes, but in this paper, we focus on more challenging cases that the scene contains dynamic objects, for example, moving people and floating curtains, which are quite common in reality and thus are eagerly required to be handled. We develop an end-to-end system using a depth sensor to scan a scene on the fly. By proposing a Sigmoid-based Iterative Closest Point (S-ICP) method, we decouple the camera motion and the scene motion from the input sequence and segment the scene into static and dynamic parts accordingly. The static part is used to estimate the camera rigid motion, while for the dynamic part, graph node-based motion representation and model-to-depth fitting are applied to reconstruct the scene motions. With the camera and scene motions reconstructed, we further propose a novel mixed voxel allocation scheme to handle static and dynamic scene parts with different mechanisms, which helps to gradually fuse a large scene with both static and dynamic objects. Experiments show that our technique successfully fuses the geometry of both the static and dynamic objects in a scene in real time, which extends the usage of the current techniques for indoor scene reconstruction.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2786233","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671268,61727808); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8241434","Scene reconstruction;dynamic reconstruction;single view","Dynamics;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Real-time systems;Image reconstruction;Geometry;Solid modeling","cameras;computer vision;graph theory;image fusion;image reconstruction;image representation;image segmentation;image sensors;image sequences;iterative methods;motion estimation;stereo image processing","dynamic objects;scene motion;static scene parts;dynamic scene parts;static objects;real-time reconstruction;real-time indoor scene reconstruction;3D geometry recovery;moving people;floating curtains;depth sensor;scene scanning;sigmoid-based iterative closest point method;camera motion;scene segmentation;camera rigid motion estimation;graph node-based motion representation;model-to-depth fitting;mixed voxel allocation;MixedFusion","","7","","30","IEEE","28 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike other machine learning applications such as image recognition, where different inputs have a uniform and consistent format (e.g., an array of all the pixels in an image), the input for deformable simulation is quite variable, high-dimensional, and parametrization-unfriendly. Consequently, even though the neural network is known for its rich expressivity of nonlinear functions, directly using an NN to reconstruct the force-displacement relation for general deformable simulation is nearly impossible. NNWarp obviates this difficulty by partially restoring the force-displacement relation via warping the nodal displacement simulated using a simplistic constitutive model-the linear elasticity. In other words, NNWarp yields an incremental displacement fix per mesh node based on a simplified (therefore incorrect) simulation result other than synthesizing the unknown displacement directly. We introduce a compact yet effective feature vector including geodesic, potential and digression to sort training pairs of per-node linear and nonlinear displacement. NNWarp is robust under different model shapes and tessellations. With the assistance of deformation substructuring, one NN training is able to handle a wide range of 3D models of various geometries. Thanks to the linear elasticity and its constant system matrix, the underlying simulator only needs to perform one pre-factorized matrix solve at each time step, which allows NNWarp to simulate large models in real time.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2881451","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CHS-1717972); AFRL(grant numbers:FA9453-18-2-0022); NSFC(grant numbers:61772462,U1736217); Microsoft Research Asia; NSFC(grant numbers:61732016); Alibaba IDEA Lab; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2017YFB1002600); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CHS-1524992); NSFC(grant numbers:61772024,61732016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8536417","Neural network;machine learning;data-driven animation;nonlinear regression;deformable model;physics-based simulation","Artificial neural networks;Deformable models;Strain;Computational modeling;Animation;Elasticity","deformation;elasticity;mechanical engineering computing;mesh generation;neural nets;solid modelling","linear elasticity;digression feature vector;potential feature vector;geodesic feature vector;effective feature vector;compact feature vector;incremental displacement fix per mesh node;deformable simulation;highly re-usable and efficient neural network;NNWarp;highly reusable network;deformation substructuring;nodal displacement;force-displacement relation;nonlinear deformable simulation framework;neural network-based nonlinear deformation","","7","","85","IEEE","15 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a novel deep learning approach that automatically and robustly filters point clouds by removing noise and preserving their sharp features. Our point-wise learning architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder directly takes points (a point and its neighbors) as input, and learns a latent representation vector which goes through the decoder to relate the ground-truth position with a displacement vector. The trained neural network can automatically generate a set of clean points from a noisy input.

Using results from optimal mass transport problems, a warp to the improved density image is computed. The graph nodes are displaced according to the warp. The warp maintains the overall structure of the graph, thus limiting disturbances to the mental map, while reducing the clutter in dense areas of the layout. The complexity of the algorithm depends mainly on the resolution of the image visualizing the graph and is linear in the size of the graph. This allows scaling the computation according to required running times.

The resulting NTGs are in turn used in a feature-centered visual analytics framework to query specific database elements and update feature parameters, facilitating flexible post hoc analysis.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934368","DFG; IRTG; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science; National Nuclear Security Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854335","Topological Data Analysis;Nested Tracking Graphs;Image Databases;Feature Tracking;Post Hoc Visual Analytics","Databases;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Motion pictures;Vegetation;Visual analytics;Task analysis","data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;interactive systems;query processing","feature-centered visual analytics framework;flexible post hoc analysis;dynamic nested tracking graphs;interactive visual analysis;large-scale simulations;topological abstractions;superlevel set components;cinema database;graph operation-based nested tracking graph algorithm;query specific database","","6","","35","IEEE","1 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our approach determines the assignment of features between two successive time-steps by solving two graph optimization problems. It first resolves one-to-one assignments of features by computing a maximum-weight, maximum-cardinality matching on a weighted bi-partite graph. Second, our algorithm detects events by creating a graph of potentially conflicting event explanations and finding a weighted, independent set in it. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on synthetic and simulation data sets, the former of which enables quantitative evaluation because of the availability of ground-truth information.

Subsequently, an iterative normalized cut algorithm is applied on each patch to separate the patch into smooth regions according to the detected features. In the second stage, a feature-aware guidance normal is constructed for each face, and guided normal filtering is applied to achieve robust feature-preserving mesh denoising.

Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data visualizations.

Commonly, a mesh surface is reconstructed from the point cloud and a high-resolution texture is generated over the mesh from the images taken at the site to represent surface materials. However, this global reconstruction and texturing approach becomes impractical with increasing data sizes. Recently, due to its potential for scalability and extensibility, a method for texturing a set of depth maps in a preprocessing and stitching them at runtime has been proposed to represent large scenes. However, the rendering performance of this method is strongly dependent on the number of depth maps and their resolution. Moreover, for the proposed scene representation, every single depth map has to be textured by the images, which in practice heavily increases processing costs. In this paper, we present a novel method to break these dependencies by introducing an efficient raytracing of multiple depth maps. In a preprocessing phase, we first generate high-resolution textured depth maps by rendering the input points from image cameras and then perform a graph-cut based optimization to assign a small subset of these points to the images. At runtime, we use the resulting point-to-image assignments (1) to identify for each view ray which depth map contains the closest ray-surface intersection and (2) to efficiently compute this intersection point. The resulting algorithm accelerates both the texturing and the rendering of the depth maps by an order of magnitude.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2430333","Austrian Research Promotion Agency(grant numbers:835948); EU FP7 project HARVEST4D(grant numbers:323567); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7102754","Point-based rendering;raytracing depth maps;large-scale models;Point-based rendering;raytracing depth maps;large-scale models","Rendering (computer graphics);Labeling;Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Surface texture;Surface reconstruction;Runtime","cameras;data visualisation;graph theory;image reconstruction;image resolution;image texture;mesh generation;optimisation;ray tracing;rendering (computer graphics)","multidepth-map raytracing;large-scene reconstruction;high-quality visualization;mesh surface;high-resolution texture;image texture;image representation;surface material representation;rendering performance;high-resolution textured depth map;graph-cut based optimization;closest ray-surface intersection","","6","","19","IEEE","6 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The approximation is used to compute a good starting point for the iteration, which ensures rapid convergence. Trimming curves are described by a tree of trimming primitives, such as squares, circles, polygons, and free-form curves, combined with Boolean operations.

The objects and their relationships are organized as a heterogeneous graph. We assign each object a set of attributes, based on which a semantic abstraction of the heterogeneous graph is generated. This semantic abstraction is SFG. We design a suite of operations to explore the underlying flow fields based on this graph representation and abstraction mechanism. Users can flexibly reconfigure SFG to examine the relationships among groups of objects at different abstraction levels. Three linked views are developed to display SFG, its node split criteria and history, and the objects in the spatial volume. For simplicity, we introduce SFG construction and exploration for steady flow fields with critical points being the only features. Then we demonstrate that SFG can be naturally extended to deal with unsteady flow fields and multiple types of features.

Our animations rely on the combination and the interpolation of textured 3D mesh data, which requires examining two aspects: (1) Shape geometry and (2) appearance. First, we propose an animation synthesis structure for the shape geometry, the Essential graph, that outperforms standard Motion graphs in optimality with respect to quantitative criteria, and we extend optimized interpolated transition algorithms to mesh data. Second, we propose a compact view-independent representation for the shape appearance.

Many classification models exist, and choosing the right one for a given task is difficult. During model selection and debugging, data scientists need to assess classifiers' performances, evaluate their learning behavior over time, and compare different models. Typically, this analysis is based on single-number performance measures such as accuracy. A more detailed evaluation of classifiers is possible by inspecting class errors. The confusion matrix is an established way for visualizing these class errors, but it was not designed with temporal or comparative analysis in mind. More generally, established performance analysis systems do not allow a combined temporal and comparative analysis of class-level information. To address this issue, we propose ConfusionFlow, an interactive, comparative visualization tool that combines the benefits of class confusion matrices with the visualization of performance characteristics over time. ConfusionFlow is model-agnostic and can be used to compare performances for different model types, model architectures, and/or training and test datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of ConfusionFlow in a case study on instance selection strategies in active learning. We further assess the scalability of ConfusionFlow and present a use case in the context of neural network pruning.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3012063","State of Upper Austria; Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung(grant numbers:LIT-2019-7-SEE-117); State of Upper Austria; Austrian Research Promotion Agency(grant numbers:FFG 851460); Austrian Science Fund(grant numbers:FWF P27975-NBL); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149790","Classification;performance analysis;time series visualization;machine learning;information visualization;quality assessment","Task analysis;Analytical models;Data models;Training;Tools;Adaptation models;Data visualization","data visualisation;feature selection;matrix algebra;neural nets;pattern classification;supervised learning","active learning;ConfusionFlow;model-agnostic visualization;classifier confusion;supervised machine learning;confusion matrix;temporal analysis;class-level information;class confusion matrices;performance characteristics;instance selection strategies;neural network pruning","","5","","63","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first introduce a novel method to make representative and nonredundant summarizations of image collections, thereby ensuring data cleanliness and emphasizing important information. Then, we propose a tree-based algorithm with a two-step optimization strategy to generate the final layout that operates as follows: (1) an initial layout is created by constructing a tree randomly based on the grouping results of the input image set; (2) the layout is refined through a coarse adjustment in a greedy manner, followed by gradient back propagation drawing on the training procedure of neural networks.

The inbetweening is context-aware in the sense that not only the stroke's shape but also the context (i.e., the neighborhood of a stroke) in which a stroke appears are taken into account for the stroke correspondence and interpolation. Given a pair of successive key frames, the CACAI automatically constructs the stroke correspondence between them by exploiting the context coherence between the corresponding strokes. Meanwhile, the construction algorithm is able to incorporate the user's interaction with ease and allows the user more effective control over the correspondence process than existing stroke matching techniques. With a one-to-one stroke correspondence, the CACAI interpolates the shape and context between the corresponding strokes for the generation of intermediate frames. In the interpolation sequence, both the shape of individual strokes and the spatial layout between them are well retained such that the feature characteristics and visual appearance of the objects in the key frames can be fully preserved even when complex motions are involved in these objects.

However, often dynamic graphs are expressed as a series of events where the nodes and edges have real coordinates along the time dimension that are not confined to discrete timeslices. Current techniques for dynamic graph drawing impose a set of timeslices on this event-based data in order to draw the dynamic graph, but it is unclear how many timeslices should be selected: too many timeslices slows the computation of the layout, while too few timeslices obscures important temporal features, such as causality. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel model for drawing event-based dynamic graphs and the first dynamic graph drawing algorithm, DynNoSlice, that is capable of drawing dynamic graphs in this model. DynNoSlice is an offline, force-directed algorithm that draws event-based, dynamic graphs in the space-time cube (2D+time). We also present a method to extract representative small multiples from the space-time cube. To demonstrate the advantages of our approach, DynNoSlice is compared with state-of-the-art timeslicing methods using a metrics-based experiment.

It provides enhancements of computational efficiency and accuracy control with respect to previous solutions. Iterative refinement allows us to perform interactive animations which could be only computed off-line using previous methods. The efficiency results from managing two sets of constraints associated with the kinematic graph, and proceeding in two steps. First, the acyclic constraints are solved in linear time. An iterative process then reduces the closed-loop errors while maintaining the acyclic constraints. This allows the user to efficiently trade off accuracy for computation time. We analyze the complexity and investigate practical efficiency compared with other approaches. In contrast with previous research, we present a single method which is computationally efficient for acyclic bodies as well as for mesh-like bodies. The accuracy control is provided by the iterative improvement performed by the algorithm and also from the existence of two constraint priority levels induced by the method. Used in conjunction with a robust integration scheme, this new algorithm allows the interactive animation of scenes containing a few thousand geometric constraints, including closed loops. It has been successfully applied to real-time simulations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.795217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=795217","","Solids;Animation;Layout;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Computational efficiency;Virtual reality;Computational modeling;Equations;Heuristic algorithms","iterative methods;computer animation;dynamics;integration;computational complexity;kinematics;solid modelling;interactive systems","fast iterative refinement;articulated solid dynamics algorithm;articulated solid animation;computational efficiency;accuracy control;interactive animation;constraint sets;kinematic graph;acyclic constraints;linear-time solution;closed-loop errors;complexity;efficiency;mesh-like bodies;constraint priority levels;robust integration scheme;geometric constraints;real-time simulations","","5","","21","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose achieving interactive transparency rendering of a static scene by sorting the triangles in back-to-front order on CPU and supplying the sorted triangles to the graphics pipeline for rendering on GPU hardware. Our sorting method sorts the triangles in object space and is built upon the binary space partition (BSP) and depth-sort methods with its behavior readily tunable to exploit the strengths of both methods. We propose novel techniques to optimize the BSP construction process with respect to multiple factors including tree construction time, tree size, and expected sorting cost. We also propose an improved depth-sort algorithm that can produce correct depth order without triangle split when no cyclic occlusion exists. We demonstrate that the proposed system results in a penalty factor of 4/spl sim/6 for various types of parts, among which the largest one has nearly 1.2 million triangles. In addition, the penalty factor may be further improved if sorting in CPU and rendering in GPU are executed in parallel. Two approximation strategies are also studied to test the practicality of our system against large CAD assemblies. Experimental results on an assembly containing over 16 million triangles distributed in about 10,000 transparent parts show that the proposed system still results in a penalty factor of 4/spl sim/6 while producing few artifacts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2005.82","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1471695","Index Terms- BSP;depth sort;transparency rendering;triangle sorting.","Rendering (computer graphics);Sorting;Graphics;Layout;Assembly systems;Inspection;Visualization;Pipelines;Hardware;Cost function","CAD;engineering graphics;rendering (computer graphics);data visualisation;solid modelling;interactive systems;computer graphic equipment;tree data structures;computational geometry;sorting","interactive transparency rendering;large CAD model;scene rendering;visual inspection;engineering visualization;graphics pipeline;GPU hardware rendering;binary space partition construction;depth-sort algorithm;tree construction;tree size;cyclic occlusion;triangle sorting","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Computer Systems;Computer-Aided Design;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Theoretical;User-Computer Interface","5","1","15","IEEE","25 Jul 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Vertices that appear in two or more hyperedges are drawn as interchanges in the metro map, connecting the different sets. MetroSets is based on a modular 4-step pipeline which constructs and optimizes a path-based hypergraph support, which is then drawn and schematized using metro map layout algorithms. We propose and implement multiple algorithms for each step of the MetroSet pipeline and provide a functional prototype with easy-to-use preset configurations.

This issue can significantly destabilize the feature embeddings and the predictions - rendering deep networks much less useful for the experts. This paper approaches this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques that enable the investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied multi-scalar aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions. Through regular exchanges with a domain expert, we design and develop a visual analytics solution that integrates 1) a Bivariate Map equipped with an advanced bivariate colormap to simultaneously depict input traffic and prediction errors across space, 2) a Moran's I Scatterplot that provides local indicators of spatial association analysis, and 3) a Multi-scale Attribution View that arranges non-linear dot plots in a tree layout to promote model analysis and comparison across scales. We evaluate our approach through a series of case studies involving a real-world dataset of Shenzhen taxi trips, and through interviews with domain experts.

However, the interactive exploration and seamless refinement of such hypergraph-based prediction models still pose a major challenge. We contribute Hyper-Matrix, a novel visual analytics technique that addresses this challenge through a tight coupling between machine-learning and interactive visualizations. In particular, the technique incorporates a geometric deep learning model as a blueprint for problem-specific models while integrating visualizations for graph-based and category-based data with a novel combination of interactions for an effective user-driven exploration of hypergraph models. To eliminate demanding context switches and ensure scalability, our matrix-based visualization provides drill-down capabilities across multiple levels of semantic zoom, from an overview of model predictions down to the content. We facilitate a focused analysis of relevant connections and groups based on interactive user-steering for filtering and search tasks, a dynamically modifiable partition hierarchy, various matrix reordering techniques, and interactive model feedback.

Through a tightly-coupled iterative design process, we built Atria, a multi-view execution graph visualization to support performance analysis. Atria simplifies the initial representation of the execution graph by aggregating nodes as related to their line of code. We deployed Atria on multiple platforms, some requiring design alteration. We describe how we adapted the design study methodology to the “moving target” of both the data and the domain experts' concerns and how this movement kept both the visualization and programming project healthy. We reflect on our process and discuss what factors allow the project to be successful in the presence of changing data and user needs.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934285","United States Department of Defense(grant numbers:FA8075-14-D-0002-0007); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF III-1656958); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8805434","design studies;software visualization;parallel computing;graph visualization","Task analysis;Data visualization;Computational modeling;Runtime;Tools;Parallel processing;Data collection","graph theory;parallel programming;program visualisation","iterative design process;Atria;multiview execution graph visualization;moving target visualization;programming project;task parallel programs;visualization projects;data availability;visualization process;data collection","","5","","64","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It contains a score chart, an evolution graph and a chess board, such that users can understand a game from global to local viewpoints. Unlike current graphical chess tools, which focus only on highlighting pieces that are under attack and require sequential investigation, our visualization shows potential outcomes after a piece is moved and indicates how much tactical advantage the player can have over the opponent. Users can first glance at the score chart to roughly obtain the growth and decline of advantages from both sides, and then examine the position relations and the piece placements, to know how the pieces are controlled and how the strategy works. To achieve this visualization, we compute the decision tree using artificial intelligence to analyze a game, in which each node represents a chess position and each edge connects two positions that are one-move different. We then merge nodes representing the same chess position, and shorten branches where nodes on them contain only two neighbors, in order to achieve readability. During the graph rendering, the nodes containing events such as draws, effective checks and checkmates, are highlighted because they show how a game is ended. As a result, our visualization helps players understand a chess game so that they can efficiently learn strategies and tactics.

The impact of this data, however, is limited unless researchers can effectively assimilate such complex information and integrate it into their daily research; interactive visualization tools are called for to support the effort. Specifically, typical studies of gene co-expression require novel visualization tools that enable the dynamic formulation and fine-tuning of hypotheses to aid the process of evaluating sensitivity of key parameters. These tools should allow biologists to develop an intuitive understanding of the structure of biological networks and discover genes residing in critical positions in networks and pathways. By using a graph as a universal representation of correlation in gene expression, our system employs several techniques that when used in an integrated manner provide innovative analytical capabilities. Our tool for interacting with gene co-expression data integrates techniques such as: graph layout, qualitative subgraph extraction through a novel 2D user interface, quantitative subgraph extraction using graph-theoretic algorithms or by compound queries, dynamic level-of-detail abstraction, and template-based fuzzy classification.

In other words, only a few stations are controlled and the remaining stations are relocated by our system. Our system supports both curvilinear and octilinear layouts when creating metro maps. It solves an optimization problem, in which even spaces, route straightness, and maximum included angles at junctions are considered to obtain a curvilinear result. The system then rotates each edge to extend either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally while approximating the station positions provided by users to generate an octilinear layout.

With the wider availability of mesh data, an efficient and intrinsic deep learning approach to processing 3D meshes is in great need. Unlike images, 3D meshes have irregular connectivity, requiring careful design to capture relations in the data. To utilize the topology information while staying robust under different triangulations, we propose to encode mesh connectivity using Laplacian spectral analysis, along with mesh feature aggregation blocks (MFABs) that can split the surface domain into local pooling patches and aggregate global information amongst them. We build a mesh hierarchy from fine to coarse using Laplacian spectral clustering, which is flexible under isometric transformations. Inside the MFABs there are pooling layers to collect local information and multi-layer perceptrons to compute vertex features of increasing complexity. To obtain the relationships among different clusters, we introduce a Correlation Net to compute a correlation matrix, which can aggregate the features globally by matrix multiplication with cluster features. Our network architecture is flexible enough to be used on meshes with different numbers of vertices. We conduct several experiments including shape segmentation and classification, and our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for these tasks on the ShapeNet and COSEG datasets.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3014449","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872440,61828204); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L182016); Royal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship(grant numbers:NAF\R2\192151); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition(grant numbers:201900055); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9159927","Mesh processing;segmentation;laplacian;deep learning","Three-dimensional displays;Laplace equations;Shape;Correlation;Machine learning;Topology;Computational modeling","belief networks;computational geometry;computer graphics;computer vision;feature extraction;graph theory;image coding;image recognition;image representation;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);mesh generation;multilayer perceptrons;object recognition;pattern clustering;solid modelling;spectral analysis","cluster features;computer vision;wider availability;mesh data;efficient learning approach;intrinsic deep learning approach;irregular connectivity;topology information;different triangulations;mesh connectivity;Laplacian spectral analysis;mesh feature aggregation blocks;MFABs;local pooling patches;aggregate global information;mesh hierarchy;coarse using Laplacian spectral clustering;local information;vertex features","","4","","61","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given a scalar field f and a selection of extrema to preserve, the proposed localized topological simplification (LTS) derives a function g that is close to f and only exhibits the selected set of extrema. Specifically, suband superlevel set components associated with undesired extrema are first locally flattened and then correctly embedded into the global scalar field, such that these regions are guaranteed-from a combinatorial perspective-to no longer contain any undesired extrema. In contrast to previous global approaches, LTS only and independently processes regions of the domain that actually need to be simplified, which already results in a noticeable speedup. Moreover, due to the localized nature of the algorithm, LTS can utilize shared-memory parallelism to simplify regions simultaneously with a high parallel efficiency (70%). Hence, LTS significantly improves interactivity for the exploration of simplification parameters and their effect on subsequent topological analysis. For such exploration tasks, LTS brings the overall execution time of a plethora of TDA pipelines from minutes down to seconds, with an average observed speedup over state-of-the-art techniques of up to ×36. Furthermore, in the special case where preserved extrema are selected based on topological persistence, an adapted version of LTS partially computes the persistence diagram and simultaneously simplifies features below a predefined persistence threshold. The effectiveness of LTS, its parallel efficiency, and its resulting benefits for TDA are demonstrated on several simulated and acquired datasets from different application domains, including physics, chemistry, and biomedical imaging.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030353","U.S. Department of Homeland Security(grant numbers:2017-ST-061-QA0001,17STQAC00001-03-03); National Science Foundation Program(grant numbers:1350573); European Commission(grant numbers:ERC-2019-COG); “TORI”(grant numbers:863464); German research foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:2057); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222093","Topological data analysis;scalar data;simplification;feature extraction;parallel computing","Computational modeling;Parallel processing;Data visualization;Data analysis;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Topology","computational geometry;data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;parallel algorithms","localized topological simplification;scalar data;localized algorithm;topological data analysis;topological analysis;shared memory parallelism;parallel computing;visualization tasks","","4","","60","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The 2D or 3D O-buffer is, in essence, a conventional image or a volume, respectively, except that samples are not restricted to a regular grid. A sample position in the O-buffer is recorded as an offset to the nearest grid point of a regular base grid (hence the name O-buffer). The O-buffer can greatly improve the expressive power of images and volumes. Image quality can be improved by storing more spatial information with samples and by avoiding multiple resamplings. It can be exploited to represent and render unstructured primitives, such as points, particles, and curvilinear or irregular volumes. The O-buffer is therefore a unified representation for a variety of graphics primitives and supports mixing them in the same scene. It is a semiregular structure which lends itself to efficient construction and rendering. O-buffers may assume a variety of forms including 2D O-buffers, 3D O-buffers, uniform O-buffers, nonuniform O-buffers, adaptive O-buffers, layered-depth O-buffers, and O-buffer trees.

Package management system developers, package maintainers, and users may consult the dependency graph when a simple listing is insufficient for their analyses. However, users working in a remote command line environment must disrupt their workflow to visualize dependency graphs in graphical programs, possibly needing to move files between devices or incur forwarding lag. Such is the case for users of Spack, an open source package management system originally developed to ease the complex builds required by supercomputing environments. To preserve the command line workflow of Spack, we develop an interactive ASCII visualization for its dependency graphs. Through interviews with Spack maintainers, we identify user goals and corresponding visual tasks for dependency graphs. We evaluate the use of our visualization through a command line-centered study, comparing it to the system's two existing approaches.

However, even the best network layout algorithms ultimately result in ‘hairball’ visualisations when the graph reaches a certain degree of complexity, requiring simplification through aggregation or interaction (such as filtering) to remain usable. Until now, there has been little data to indicate at what level of complexity node-link diagrams become ineffective or how visual complexity affects cognitive load. To this end, we conducted a controlled study to understand workload limits for a task that requires a detailed understanding of the network topology-finding the shortest path between two nodes. We tested performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected performance measures (accuracy and response time), subjective feedback, and physiological measures (EEG, pupil dilation, and heart rate variability). To the best of our knowledge this is the first network visualisation study to include physiological measures. Our results show that people have significant difficulty finding the shortest path in high density node-link diagrams with more than 50 nodes and even low density graphs with more than 100 nodes. From our collected EEG data we observe functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. We found that cognitive load increased up to certain level of difficulty after which it decreased, likely because participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty. We found that global features generally had a greater impact than those of the shortest path.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030459","Australian Research Council (ARC)(grant numbers:DP140100077); Harvard Physical Sciences and Engineering Accelerator Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290431","Data Visualisation;Network Visualisation;Cognitive Load;EEG","Task analysis;Data visualization;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Electroencephalography;Visualization;Physiology","cognition;electroencephalography;feedback;medical signal processing;neural nets","network topology;heart rate variability;network visualisation;high density node-link diagrams;cognitive load perspective;network layout algorithms;complexity node-link diagrams;visual complexity;EEG;pupil dilation;brain activity","Algorithms;Cognition;Computer Graphics;Humans","4","","67","IEEE","10 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Coordinated relationships can be formalized as biclusters. In order to support visual exploration of biclusters, bipartite graphs based visualizations have been proposed, and edge bundling is used to show biclusters. However, it suffers from edge crossings due to possible overlaps of biclusters, and lacks in-depth understanding of its impact on user exploring biclusters in bipartite graphs. To address these, we propose a novel bicluster-based seriation technique that can reduce edge crossings in bipartite graphs drawing and conducted a user experiment to study the effect of edge bundling and this proposed technique on visualizing biclusters in bipartite graphs.

Automating attribute conditional graphic layouts remains a complex and unsolved problem. In this article, we introduce Attribute-conditioned Layout GAN to incorporate the attributes of design elements for graphic layout generation by forcing both the generator and the discriminator to meet attribute conditions. Due to the complexity of graphic designs, we further propose an element dropout method to make the discriminator look at partial lists of elements and learn their local patterns. In addition, we introduce various loss designs following different design principles for layout optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed method can synthesize graphic layouts conditioned on different element attributes. It can also adjust well-designed layouts to new sizes while retaining elements' original reading-orders.

To address these issues, we investigated a novel way of handling visual aggregation with a task-driven and user-centered approach.

Second, our system then computes a smooth and structural preserving transition between these specified areas. Lastly, the user can further fine-tune the global visualization with a direct manipulation technique to remove the local ambiguity and to apply different visual deformations.

These tools allow data analysts to represent multidimensional data in a 2D or 3D space, while preserving as much relevant information as possible. Yet, they cannot preserve all structures simultaneously and they induce some unavoidable distortions. Hence, many criteria have been introduced to evaluate a map's overall quality, mostly based on the preservation of neighbourhoods. Such global indicators are currently used to compare several maps, which helps to choose the most appropriate mapping method and its hyperparameters. However, those aggregated indicators tend to hide the local repartition of distortions. Thereby, they need to be supplemented by local evaluation to ensure correct interpretation of maps.In this paper, we describe a new method, called MING, for ""Map Interpretation using Neighbourhood Graphs"". It offers a graphical interpretation of pairs of map quality indicators, as well as local evaluation of the distortions. This is done by displaying on the map the nearest neighbours graphs computed in the data space and in the embedding. Shared and unshared edges exhibit reliable and unreliable neighbourhood information conveyed by the mapping. By this mean, analysts may determine whether proximity (or remoteness) of points on the map faithfully represents similarity (or dissimilarity) of original data, within the meaning of a chosen map quality criteria. We apply this approach to two pairs of widespread indicators: precision/recall and trustworthiness/continuity, chosen for their wide use in the community, which will allow an easy handling by users.","","978-1-7281-4941-7","10.1109/VISUAL.2019.8933568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933568","Evaluation—Qualitative Evaluation;Non-Spatial Data and Techniques—Dimensionality Reduction;Visual Analysis and Knowledge Discovery—Visual Knowledge Discovery","Distortion;Reliability;Image color analysis;Data visualization;Visualization;Dimensionality reduction;Three-dimensional displays","data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory","local evaluation;correct interpretation;map interpretation;graphical interpretation;map quality indicators;data space;unreliable neighbourhood information;widespread indicators;visual data exploration;dimensionality reduction methods;data analysts;multidimensional data;unavoidable distortions;global indicators;mapping method;aggregated indicators;local repartition;neighbourhood graphs;MING;map quality criteria","","3","","22","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our framework trains an unsupervised 3D convolutional neural network to extract global model features and then outputs possible global symmetry parameters, where input shapes are represented using voxels. We introduce a dedicated symmetry distance loss along with a regularization loss to avoid generating duplicated symmetry planes. Our network can also identify generalized cylinders by predicting their rotation axes. We further provide a method to remove invalid and duplicated planes and axes.

However, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic discriminability, the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts, based on the visual features and concepts alone (i.e., without help from verbal cues such as legends or labels). Previous evidence suggested that observers were better at interpreting encoding systems that maximized semantic discriminability (maximizing association strength between assigned colors and concepts while minimizing association strength between unassigned colors and concepts), compared to a system that only maximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing semantic discriminability also resulted in increased perceptual distance, so it is unclear which factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present study, we conducted two experiments that tested for independent effects of semantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability of bar graph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was large enough to ensure colors were more than just noticeably different. We found that increasing semantic distance improved performance, independent of variation in perceptual distance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated, responses were dominated by semantic distance. These results have implications for navigating trade-offs in color palette design optimization for visual communication.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239918","Visual Reasoning;Information Visualization;Visual Communication;Visual Encoding;Color Perception;Color Cognition","Semantics;Color;Visualization;Observers;Image color analysis;Data visualization;Encoding","data visualisation;encoding;graph theory","perceptual discriminability;semantic discriminability;visual features;encoding systems;association strength;perceptual distance;bar graph data visualizations;visual communication;information visualizations;semantic distance","","3","","41","IEEE","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure.

Based on the current Chicago Classification, which serves as the gold standard in this area, we introduce a visualization supporting an efficient and correct diagnosis. To reach this goal, we propose a novel decision graph representing the Chicago Classification with workflow optimization in mind. Based on this graph, we are further able to prioritize the different metrics used during diagnosis and can exploit this prioritization in the actual data visualization. Thus, different disorders and their related parameters are directly represented and intuitively influence the appearance of our visualization. Within this paper, we introduce our novel visualization, justify the design decisions, and provide the results of a user study we performed with medical students as well as a domain expert.

Thus it can help new developers, managers, and testers understand the history of development without needing to dig into a large pile of unfamiliar source code. However, the current tools for Git visualization are not adequate to analyze and explore the metadata: They focus mainly on improving the usability of Git commands instead of on helping users understand the development history. Furthermore, they do not scale for large and complex Git commit graphs, which can play an important role in understanding the overall development history. In this paper, we present Githru, an interactive visual analytics system that enables developers to effectively understand the context of development history through the interactive exploration of Git metadata. We design an interactive visual encoding idiom to represent a large Git graph in a scalable manner while preserving the topological structures in the Git graph. To enable scalable exploration of a large Git commit graph, we propose novel techniques (graph reconstruction, clustering, and Context-Preserving Squash Merge (CSM) methods) to abstract a large-scale Git commit graph. Based on these Git commit graph abstraction techniques, Githru provides an interactive summary view to help users gain an overview of the development history and a comparison view in which users can compare different clusters of commits. The efficacy of Githru has been demonstrated by case studies with domain experts using real-world, in-house datasets from a large software development team at a major international IT company. A controlled user study with 12 developers comparing Githru to previous tools also confirms the effectiveness of Githru in terms of task completion time.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222261","git;history;exploration;overview;repository;visualization;cluster;DAG","History;Metadata;Software;Visualization;Interviews;Tools;Complexity theory","data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;meta data;program visualisation;software engineering","Githru;software development team;software development history;Git metadata;software development project;Git visualization;Git commands;complex Git commit graphs;interactive visual analytics system;interactive visual encoding idiom;Git commit graph abstraction techniques;visual analytics","Computer Graphics;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Metadata;Software","2","","75","CCBY","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To support such investigations, visual analysis tools use biclustering to mine relationships in bipartite graphs and visualize the resulting biclusters with standard graph visualization techniques. Due to overlaps among biclusters, such visualizations can be cluttered (e.g., with many edge crossings), when there are a large number of biclusters. Prior work attempted to resolve this problem by automatically ordering nodes in a bipartite graph. However, visual clutter is still a serious problem, since the number of displayed biclusters remains unchanged. We propose bicluster aggregation as an alternative approach, and have developed two methods of interactively merging biclusters. These interactive bicluster aggregations help organize similar biclusters and reduce the number of displayed biclusters.

Participating media has a translucent aspect that comes from light being scattered inside the material. For materials with a small mean-free-path (mfp), multiple scattering effects dominate. Simulating these effects is computationally intensive, as it requires tracking a large number of scattering events inside the material. Existing approaches precompute multiple scattering events inside the material and store the results in a table. During rendering time, this table is used to compute the scattering effects. While these methods are faster than explicit scattering computation, they incur higher storage costs. In this paper, we present a new representation for double and multiple scattering effects that uses a neural network model. The scattering response from all homogeneous participating media is encoded into a neural network in a preprocessing step. At run time, the neural network is then used to predict the double and multiple scattering effects.

However, these simulation models tend to be computationally very expensive and involve a large number of simulation input parameters, which need to be analyzed and properly calibrated before the models can be applied for real scientific studies. We propose a visual analysis system to facilitate interactive exploratory analysis of high-dimensional input parameter space for a complex yeast cell polarization simulation. The proposed system can assist the computational biologists, who designed the simulation model, to visually calibrate the input parameters by modifying the parameter values and immediately visualizing the predicted simulation outcome without having the need to run the original expensive simulation for every instance. Our proposed visual analysis system is driven by a trained neural network-based surrogate model as the backend analysis framework. In this work, we demonstrate the advantage of using neural networks as surrogate models for visual analysis by incorporating some of the recent advances in the field of uncertainty quantification, interpretability and explainability of neural network-based models. We utilize the trained network to perform interactive parameter sensitivity analysis of the original simulation as well as recommend optimal parameter configurations using the activation maximization framework of neural networks. We also facilitate detail analysis of the trained network to extract useful insights about the simulation model, learned by the network, during the training process. We performed two case studies, and discovered multiple new parameter configurations, which can trigger high cell polarization results in the original simulation model.

We introduce a novel procedural model called PICO (Procedural Iterative Constrained Optimizer) and PICO-Graph that is the underlying procedural model designed with optimization in mind. The key novelty of PICO is that it enables the exploration of generative designs by combining both user and environmental constraints into a single framework by using optimization without the need to write procedural rules. The PICO-Graph procedural model consists of a set of geometry generating operations and a set of axioms connected in a directed cyclic graph. The forward generation is initiated by a set of axioms that use the connections to send coordinate systems and geometric objects through the PICO-Graph, which in turn generates more objects. This allows for fast generation of complex and varied geometries. Moreover, we combine PICO-Graph with efficient optimization that allows for quick exploration of the generated models and the generation of variants. The user defines the rules, the axioms, and the set of constraints; for example, whether an existing object should be supported by the generated model, whether symmetries exist, whether the object should spin, etc. PICO then generates a class of geometric models and optimizes them so that they fulfill the constraints. The generation and the optimization in our implementation provides interactive user control during model execution providing continuous feedback. For example, the user can sketch the constraints and guide the geometry to meet these specified goals. We show PICO on a variety of examples such as the generation of procedural chairs with multiple supports, generation of support structures for 3D printing, generation of spinning objects, or generation of procedural terrains matching a given input. Our framework could be used as a component in a larger design workflow; its strongest application is in the early rapid ideation and prototyping phases.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.2995556","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:#10001387); Functional Proceduralization of 3D Geometric Models; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095367","Computational geometry and object modeling;three-dimensional graphics and realism","Optimization;Geometry;Shape;Computational modeling;Grammar;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling","computational geometry;directed graphs;graph theory;iterative methods;optimisation;solid modelling","Procedural Iterative Constrained Optimizer;geometry generating operations;axioms;continuous feedback;PICO Graph procedural model;environmental constraints;user constraints;procedural terrains;procedural chairs;execution model;geometric models;forward generation;directed cyclic graph","","2","","70","IEEE","18 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This requires formulating an online variant of the well-known view-planning problem, which must take into account what parts of the scene have already been seen and how the lumigraph sample distribution could improve in the future. We address this highly unconstrained problem by regularizing the scene structure using a regular grid structure. Upon the grid structure, we define a coverage metric describing how well the lumigraph samples cover the grid in terms of spatial and angular resolution, and we greedily keep incoming views if they improve the coverage. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm quantitatively and qualitatively on a variety of synthetic and real scenes, and demonstrate visually appealing results obtained at real-time frame rates (in the range of 3Hz-100Hz per incoming image, depending on configuration).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2932237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794622","Lumigraph;virtual reality;rendering;real-time;view planning;keyframe selection;multi-view","Planning;Image reconstruction;Real-time systems;Geometry;Rendering (computer graphics);Computational modeling;Image color analysis","graph theory;image resolution;image texture;interactive systems;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","time view planning;unstructured lumigraph modeling;image stream;mixed reality;telepresence;interior design;conventional texture optimization;strictly incremental manner;online variant;well-known view-planning problem;lumigraph sample distribution;highly unconstrained problem;scene structure;regular grid structure;lumigraph samples;spatial resolution;angular resolution;incoming views;synthetic scenes;real scenes;real-time frame rates","","2","","51","IEEE","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rendering a 512 x 512 image of a simple scene can require more than 196 Gbytes of raw bandwidth to the photon map data structure. This bandwidth is a major obstacle to real-time photon mapping. This paper investigates two approaches for reducing the required bandwidth: 1) reordering the <i>k</i>NN searches and 2) cache conscious data structures. Using a Hilbert curve reordering, we demonstrate an experimental lower bound of 15 Mbytes of bandwidth for the same scene. Unfortunately, this improvement of four orders of magnitude requires a prohibitive amount of intermediate storage. We introduce two novel cost-effective algorithms that reduce the bandwidth by one order of magnitude. Scenes of different complexities are shown to exhibit similar reductions in bandwidth. We explain why the choice of data structure does not achieve similar reductions. We also examine the interaction of query reordering with two photon map acceleration techniques, importance sampling, and the irradiance cache. Query reordering exploits the additional coherence that arises from the use of importance sampling in scenes with glossy surfaces. Irradiance caching also benefits from query reordering, even when complex surface geometry reduces the effectiveness of the irradiance cache.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2007.70413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359492","Global Illumination;Photon Mapping;Importance Sampling;Irradiance Caching;Graphics Hardware;Global Illumination;Photon Mapping;Importance Sampling;Irradiance Caching;Graphics Hardware","Bandwidth;Layout;Data structures;Lighting;Casting;Monte Carlo methods;Geometry;Hardware;Rendering (computer graphics);Acceleration","cache storage;data structures;image sampling;rendering (computer graphics)","photon-mapping bandwidth;query reordering;image rendering;photon map data structure;kNN search;Hilbert curve reordering;irradiance cache;importance sampling","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Light;Lighting;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Photometry;Photons;Radiation Dosage;Radiometry;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","2","3","37","","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Responsive matrix cells are local zoomable regions of interest that provide auxiliary data exploration and editing facilities for multivariate graphs. They behave responsively by adapting their visual contents to the cell location, the available display space, and the user task. Responsive matrix cells enable users to reveal details about the graph, compare node and edge attributes, and edit data values directly in a matrix without resorting to external views or tools. We report the general design considerations for responsive matrix cells covering the visual and interactive means necessary to support a seamless data exploration and editing.

Creating infographics is a difficult and time-consuming process which often requires significant attempts and adjustments even for experienced designers, not to mention novice users with limited design expertise. Recently, a few approaches have been proposed to automate the creation process by applying predefined blueprints to user information. However, predefined blueprints are often hard to create, hence limited in volume and diversity. In contrast, good infogrpahics have been created by professionals and accumulated on the Internet rapidly. These online examples often represent a wide variety of design styles, and serve as exemplars or inspiration to people who like to create their own infographics. Based on these observations, we propose to generate infographics by automatically imitating examples. We present a two-stage approach, namely retrieve-then-adapt. In the retrieval stage, we index online examples by their visual elements. For a given user information, we transform it to a concrete query by sampling from a learned distribution about visual elements, and then find appropriate examples in our example library based on the similarity between example indexes and the query. For a retrieved example, we generate an initial drafts by replacing its content with user information. However, in many cases, user information cannot be perfectly fitted to retrieved examples. Therefore, we further introduce an adaption stage. Specifically, we propose a MCMC-like approach and leverage recursive neural networks to help adjust the initial draft and improve its visual appearance iteratively, until a satisfactory result is obtained. We implement our approach on widely-used proportion-related infographics, and demonstrate its effectiveness by sample results and expert reviews.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030448","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9233469","Infographics;automatic visualization","Visualization;Layout;Libraries;Tools;Internet;Indexes;Neural networks","data visualisation;image retrieval;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","example-based automatic generation;data visualization technique;graphic descriptions;textual descriptions;aesthetics;experienced designers;design expertise;creation process;predefined blueprints;online examples;design styles;two-stage approach;retrieval stage;visual elements;user information;example library;example indexes;adaption stage;visual appearance;proportion-related infographics;initial draft generation;retrieve-then-adapt;Internet;MCMC-like approach;recursive neural networks","","2","","38","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Vertical lines are rendered longer and closer to each other than horizontal lines. This problem is inherent in the technique and has two main consequences: (1) clusters which have a steep slope between two axes are visually more prominent than horizontal clusters. (2) Noise and clutter can be perceived as clusters, as a few parallel vertical lines visually emerge as a ghost cluster. Our paper makes two contributions: First, we formalize the problem and show its impact. Second, we present a novel technique to reduce the effects by rendering the polylines of the parallel coordinates based on their slope: horizontal lines are rendered with the default width, lines with a steep slope with a thinner line. Our technique avoids density distortions of clusters, can be computed in linear time, and can be added on top of most parallel coordinate variations.

Consequently, sampling strategies have been mostly ad hoc, and evaluation of the resulting approximations has been difficult. In this paper, the structure of penumbral irradiance is investigated empirically and numerically. This study has been made feasible by the use of the discontinuity mesh and the backprojection, an efficient data structure representing visibility in regions of partial occlusion. Regions of penumbrae in which irradiance varies nonmonotonically are characterized empirically, and numerical tests are performed to determine the frequency of their occurrence. This study inspired the development of two algorithms for the construction of interpolating approximations to irradiance: one algorithm reduces the number of edges in the mesh defining the interpolant domain; and the other algorithm chooses among linear, quadratic, and mixed interpolants based on irradiance monotonicity. Results from numerical tests and images are presented that demonstrate good performance of the new algorithms for various realistic test configurations.","1941-0506","","10.1109/2945.556499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=556499","","Lighting;Light sources;Testing;Layout;Sampling methods;Data structures;Frequency;Image sampling;Performance evaluation;Interpolation","brightness;rendering (computer graphics);computational geometry;data structures;interpolation;mesh generation","structured penumbral irradiance computation;computational expense;area light source;sampling strategies;approximations;discontinuity mesh;backprojection;data structure;partial occlusion;numerical tests;interpolating approximations;mixed interpolants;linear interpolants;quadratic interpolants;irradiance monotonicity;performance;rendering;illumination;radiosity","","2","","34","","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of these representations is a Morse Connection Graph (MCG), a directed graph whose nodes correspond to Morse sets, generalizing stationary points and periodic trajectories, and arcs - to trajectories connecting them. While being useful for simple vector fields, the MCG can be hard to comprehend for topologically rich vector fields, containing a large number of features. This paper describes a visual representation of the MCG, inspired by previous work on graph visualization. Our approach aims to preserve the spatial relationships between the MCG arcs and nodes and highlight the coherent behavior of connecting trajectories. Using simulations of ocean flow, we show that it can provide useful information on the flow structure. This paper focuses specifically on MCGs computed for piecewise constant (PC) vector fields. In particular, we describe extensions of the PC framework that make it more flexible and better suited for analysis of data on complex shaped domains with a boundary. We also describe a topology simplification scheme that makes our MCG visualizations less ambiguous. Despite the focus on the PC framework, our approach could also be applied to graph representations or topological skeletons computed using different methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634162","Trajectory;Computer graphics;Topology;Corporate acquisitions;Two dimensional displays;Morse connection graph;Vector field topology","Trajectory;Computer graphics;Topology;Corporate acquisitions;Two dimensional displays","data visualisation;graph theory;vectors","Morse connection graph visualization;multiscale graph representations;Morse sets;stationary points;periodic trajectories;topologically rich 2D vector fields;MCG visual representation;MCG arcs;MCG nodes;PC vector field;piecewise constant vector field;topological skeletons","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Theoretical","2","","34","","16 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We develop a method to compute it based on a classification network and a Markov Random Field (MRF). The classification network learns view-based distinction by handling multiple views of a 3D object. Using a classification network has an advantage of avoiding the training data problem which has become a major obstacle of applying deep learning to 3D object understanding tasks. The MRF estimates the parameters of a linear model for combining the view-based distinction maps. The experiments using several publicly accessible datasets show that the distinctive regions detected by our method are not just significantly different from those detected by methods based on handcrafted features, but more consistent with human perception. We also compare it with other perceptual measures and quantitatively evaluate its performance in the context of two applications.

In numerical experiments, Eiffel summarization results outperformed those of traditional clustering algorithms with respect to the influence-flow-based objective.

We conducted two controlled user experiments to evaluate our technique on influence graph summarization and visualization respectively.

To create an occupancy bitmap, we rasterize marks onto a bitmap based on the area they occupy in the chart. With the bitmap, we can efficiently place labels without overlapping existing marks, regardless of the number and geometric complexity of the marks.

However, previous detection methods of the viscous and gravitational fingers are based on density thresholding, which provides limited geometric information of the fingers. The geometric structures of fingers and their evolution are important yet little studied in the literature. In this article, we explore the geometric detection and evolution of the fingers in detail to elucidate the dynamics of the instability. We propose a ridge voxel detection method to guide the extraction of finger cores from three-dimensional (3D) scalar fields. After skeletonizing finger cores into skeletons, we design a spanning tree based approach to capture how fingers branch spatially from the finger skeletons. Finally, we devise a novel geometric-glyph augmented tracking graph to study how the fingers and their branches grow, merge, and split over time.

We consider two versions of the problem: fixed projections and variable projections. MPSE with fixed projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices defined on the data points, along with the same number of projections and embeds the points in 3D so that the pairwise distances are preserved in the given projections. MPSE with variable projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices and embeds the points in 3D while also computing the appropriate projections that preserve the pairwise distances. The proposed approach can be useful in multiple scenarios: from creating simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs on the same set of vertices, to reconstructing a 3D object from multiple 2D snapshots, to analyzing data from multiple points of view. We provide a functional prototype of MPSE that is based on an adaptive and stochastic generalization of multi-dimensional scaling to multiple distances and multiple variable projections.

We first propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and without an associated textual narrative.

Consequently, applications must either reduce rendering and simulation complexity - along with the richness of the experience - or offload complexity to a server. Within the context of edge-computing, a popular way to do this is through render streaming. Render streaming has been demonstrated for desktops and consoles. It has also been explored for HMDs. However, the latency requirements of head tracking make this application much more challenging. While mobile GPUs are not yet as capable as their desktop counterparts, we note that they are becoming more powerful and efficient. With the hard requirements of VR, it is worth continuing to investigate what schemes could optimally balance load, latency and quality. We propose an alternative we call edge-physics: streaming at the scene-graph level from a simulation running on edge-resources, analogous to cluster rendering. Scene streaming is not only straightforward, but compute and bandwidth efficient. The most demanding loops run locally. Jobs that hit the power-wall of mobile CPUs are off-loaded, while improving GPUs are leveraged, maximising compute utilisation. In this paper we create a prototypical implementation and evaluate its potential in terms of fidelity, bandwidth and performance. We show that an effective system which maintains high consistencies on typical edge-links can be easily built, but that some traditional concepts are not applicable, and a better understanding of the perception of motion is required to evaluate such a system comprehensively.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3067757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9382921","virtual reality;streaming;edge-computing","Streaming media;Physics;Bandwidth;Quality of service;Servers;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics)","graph theory;graphics processing units;mobile computing;power aware computing;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","edge physics simulations;VR;mobile HMDs;power requirements;offload complexity;edge-computing;render streaming;latency requirements;head tracking;mobile GPUs;desktop counterparts;hard requirements;scene-graph level;edge-resources;cluster rendering;scene streaming;power-wall;mobile CPUs;typical edge-links;quality of service impact;simulation complexity;motion perception","","1","","55","IEEE","22 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Scalable Mesh Refinement for Canonical Polygonal Schemas of Extremely High Genus Shapes","M. Livesu","CNR IMATI, Genova, Liguria, Italy","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","24 Nov 2020","2021","27","1","254","260","Any closed manifold of genus g can be cut open to form a topological disk and then mapped to a regular polygon with 4g sides. This construction is called the canonical polygonal schema of the manifold, and is a key ingredient for many applications in graphics and engineering, where a parameterization between two shapes with same topology is often needed. The sides of the 4g-gon define on the manifold a system of loops, which all intersect at a single point and are disjoint elsewhere. Computing a shortest system of loops of this kind is NP-hard. A computationally tractable alternative consists of computing a set of shortest loops that are not fully disjoint in polynomial time using the greedy homotopy basis algorithm proposed by Erickson and Whittlesey and then detach them in post processing via mesh refinement. Despite this operation is conceptually simple, known refinement strategies do not scale well for high genus shapes, triggering a mesh growth that may exceed the amount of memory available in modern computers, leading to failures. In this article we study various local refinement operators to detach cycles in a system of loops, and show that there are important differences between them, both in terms of mesh complexity and preservation of the original surface. We ultimately propose two novel refinement approaches: the former greatly reduces the number of new elements in the mesh, possibly at the cost of a deviation from the input geometry. The latter allows to trade mesh complexity for geometric accuracy, bounding deviation from the input surface. Both strategies are trivial to implement, and experiments confirm that they allow to realize canonical polygonal schemas even for extremely high genus shapes where previous methods fail.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3010736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145719","Topology;polygonal schema;cut graph;homology;homotopy","Manifolds;Shape;Basis algorithms;Geometry;Complexity theory;Topology;Robustness","computational complexity;computational geometry;geometry;mesh generation;polynomials;solid modelling","greedy homotopy basis algorithm;mesh growth;local refinement operators;mesh complexity;canonical polygonal schema;scalable mesh refinement;polygonal schemas;topological disk;genus shapes","","1","","24","IEEE","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the geometry of a streamgraph is controlled by its baseline (the bottom-most curve) and the ordering of the layers, we re-interpret baseline computation and layer ordering algorithms in terms of reducing sine illusion effects. For baseline computation, we improve previous methods by introducing a Gaussian weight to penalize layers with large thickness changes. For layer ordering, three design requirements are proposed and implemented through a hierarchical clustering algorithm.

First, to address the problem of scarcity of training sketch data, we present a sketch augmentation method that more closely mimics human sketches compared to simple image transformation. Our method generates more sketches from the existing training data by (i) removing a stroke, (ii) adjusting a stroke, and (iii) rotating the sketch. As such, we generate a large number of sketch samples for training our neural network. Second, we obtain the 2D renderings of each 3D model in the shape database by determining the view positions that best depict the 3D shape: i.e., avoiding self-occlusion, showing the most salient features, and following how a human would normally sketch the model. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the best viewing positions of each 3D model and generates their 2D images for the next step. Third, our method uses a cross-domain learning strategy based on two Siamese CNNs that pair up sketches and the 2D shape images. A joint Bayesian measure is used to measure the output similarity from these CNNs to maximize inter-class similarity and minimize intra-class similarity.

Furthermore, these approaches are often limited to static hierarchies or exclude complex hierarchical changes in the data, limiting their use cases. We propose a novel visual metaphor capable of providing a static overview of all hierarchical changes over time, as well as clearly outlining the hierarchical structure at each individual time step. Our method allows for smooth transitions between treemaps and nested streamgraphs, enabling the exploration of the trade-off between dynamic behavior and hierarchical structure.

These systems can support graphics-driven practices by bridging lazy data-binding mechanisms with vector-graphics editing tools. Yet, despite their expressive power, visualization authoring systems often assume that users want to generate visual representations that they already have in mind rather than explore designs. They also impose a data-to-graphics workflow, where binding data dimensions to graphical properties is a necessary step for generating visualization layouts. In this paper, we introduce StructGraphics, an approach for creating data-agnostic and fully reusable visualization designs. StructGraphics enables designers to construct visualization designs by drawing graphics on a canvas and then structuring their visual properties without relying on a concrete dataset or data schema. In StructGraphics, tabular data structures are derived directly from the structure of the graphics. Later, designers can link these structures with real datasets through a spreadsheet user interface. StructGraphics supports the design and reuse of complex data visualizations by combining graphical property sharing, by-example design specification, and persistent layout constraints. We demonstrate the power of the approach through a gallery of visualization examples and reflect on its strengths and limitations in interaction with graphic designers and data visualization experts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222091","Visualization design;graphical structures;visualization grammars;layout constraints;infographics;flexible data binding","Data visualization;Layout;Visualization;Tools;Programming;Task analysis","authoring systems;computer graphics;data structures;data visualisation;interactive systems;spreadsheet programs;user interfaces","fully reusable visualization designs;StructGraphics;visual properties;concrete dataset;tabular data structures;spreadsheet user interface;complex data visualizations;graphical property sharing;by-example design specification;visualization examples;graphic designers;data visualization experts;flexible visualization design;reusable graphical structures;information visualization research;powerful systems;author custom data visualizations;textual programming;graphics-driven practices;lazy data-binding mechanisms;vector-graphics editing tools;expressive power;visualization authoring systems;visual representations;explore designs;data-to-graphics workflow;binding data dimensions;visualization layouts;data-agnostic structures","","1","","59","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since these tasks are key for understanding the dynamic aspects of the network, understanding which interactive visualizations best support these tasks is important. We present the results of a series of laboratory experiments comparing two traditional approaches (small multiples and interactive animation), with a more recent approach based on interactive timeslicing.

This data structure allows us to compress, render, and query segmentation histograms. Such histograms arise when building a mipmap of a volume containing segmentation IDs. Each voxel in the histogram mipmap contains a convex combination (mixture) of segmentation IDs. Each mixture represents the distribution of IDs in the respective voxel's children. Our method factorizes these mixtures into a series of linear interpolations between exactly two segmentation IDs. The result is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are topologically ordered. Pruning replicate nodes in the tree followed by compression allows us to store the resulting data structure efficiently. During rendering, transfer functions are propagated from sources (leafs) through the DAG to allow for efficient, pre-filtered rendering at interactive frame rates. Assembly of histogram contributions across the footprint of a given volume allows us to efficiently query partial histograms, achieving up to 178 x speed-up over naive parallelized range queries.

With very few exceptions, projection techniques are designed to map data from a high-dimensional space to a visual space so as to preserve some dissimilarity (similarity) measure, such as the Euclidean distance for example. In fact, although adopting distinct mathematical formulations designed to favor different aspects of the data, most multidimensional projection methods strive to preserve dissimilarity measures that encapsulate geometric properties such as distances or the proximity relation between data objects. However, geometric relations are not the only interesting property to be preserved in a projection. For instance, the analysis of particular structures such as clusters and outliers could be more reliably performed if the mapping process gives some guarantee as to topological invariants such as connected components and loops. This paper introduces TopoMap, a novel projection technique which provides topological guarantees during the mapping process. In particular, the proposed method performs the mapping from a high-dimensional space to a visual space, while preserving the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the high-dimensional data, ensuring that the filtrations generate the same connected components when applied to the original as well as projected data. The presented case studies show that the topological guarantee provided by TopoMap not only brings confidence to the visual analytic process but also can be used to assist in the assessment of other projection methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030441","DARPA D3M program; Moore Sloan Data Science Environment at NYU; NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1229185,CCF-1533564,CNS-1544753,CNS-1730396,CNS-1828576); European Commission(grant numbers:ERC-2019-COG); “TORI”(grant numbers:863464); CNPq-Brazil(grant numbers:303552/2017-4,304301/2019-1); Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) - Brazil(grant numbers:2013/07375-0,2016/04190-7,2018/07551-6,2018/24293-0); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9222271","Topological data analysis;computational topology;high-dimensional data;projection","Three-dimensional displays;Data visualization;Two dimensional displays;Data analysis;Layout;Visualization;Topology","computational geometry;data analysis;data visualisation;graph theory;solid modelling;topology","visual analytic process;projected data;0-dimensional persistence diagram;topological guarantee;novel projection technique;mapping process;data objects;encapsulate geometric properties;multidimensional projection methods;dissimilarity measure;visual space;high-dimensional space;map data;projection techniques;visualization;high-dimensional data analytics;0-dimensional homology preserving projection;TopoMap","","1","","79","IEEE","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, with an increasing number of independent variables, this process may become cumbersome and time-consuming due to the many possible combinations that have to be explored. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visualize correlations between input variables and a target output variable that scales to hundreds of variables. We developed a visual model based on neural networks that can be explored in a guided way to help analysts find and understand such correlations. First, we train a neural network to predict the target from the input variables. Then, we visualize the inner workings of the resulting model to help understand relations within the data set. We further introduce a new regularization term for the backpropagation algorithm that encourages the neural network to learn representations that are easier to interpret visually.

In many applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however, computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage, while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114872","National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:1664848,1664858); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552880","Topological data analysis;Persistence diagrams;Persistence diagram distances;Learned hashing;Clustering","Binary codes;Training;Propagation losses;Histograms;Generative adversarial networks;Hash functions;Water resources","binary codes;data visualisation;file organisation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern clustering;topology","filtered topological spaces;computational cost;binary code representation;diagram distance loss function;standard representations;Hamming distance;diagram clustering;domain-oblivious approach;data visualization;persistence diagram hashing;generative adversarial network;GAN;learning;topological similarity properties;datasets;vectorized representations;memory usage","","","","84","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When there are more than just a few labels, the efficiency of the interface decreases as the user has to search for a given label sequentially. The search can be accelerated by sorting the labels alphabetically, but sorting all labels results in long and intersecting leader lines from the anchor points to the labels. This paper proposes a partially-sorted concentric label layout that leverages the search efficiency of sorting while avoiding the label display problems of long or intersecting leader lines. The labels are partitioned into a small number of sorted sequences displayed on circles of increasing radii. Since the labels on a circle are sorted, the user can quickly search each circle. A tight upper bound derived from circular permutation theory limits the number of circles and thereby the complexity of the label layout. For example, 12 labels require at most three circles. When the application allows it, the labels are presorted to further reduce the number of circles in the layout. The layout was tested in a user study where it significantly reduced the label searching time compared to a conventional single-circle layout.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3106492","National Natural Science Foundation of China through Projects(grant numbers:61932003,61772051); National Key RD plan(grant numbers:2019YFC1521102); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L182016); Beijing Program for International ST Cooperation Project(grant numbers:Z191100001619003); Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data(Shenzhen)(grant numbers:518000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9523830","Augmented Reality;Label layout;Fast label finding","Layout;Sorting;Annotations;Search problems;Labeling;Gaze tracking;Augmented reality","augmented reality;computational complexity;data visualisation;sorting;text analysis","efficient label localization;Augmented Reality labeling;label text;given label;labels results;partially-sorted concentric label layout;label display problems;circle;partially-sorted concentric layout","","","","49","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In real systems, such as those found in ecology, the relationships between time series variables are generally not static; instead, these relationships are dynamical and change in a nonlinear or state-dependent manner. To further understand such systems, we investigate integrating methods that appropriately characterize these dynamics (i.e., methods that measure interactions as they change with time-varying system states) with visualization techniques that can help analyze the behavior of the system. Here, we focus on empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as a state-of-the-art method that specifically identifies causal variables and measures changing state-dependent relationships between time series variables. Instead of using approaches centered on parametric equations, EDM is an equation-free approach that studies systems based on their dynamic attractors. We propose a visual analytics system to support the identification and mechanistic interpretation of system states using an EDM-constructed dynamic graph. This work, as detailed in four analysis tasks and demonstrated with a GUI, provides a novel synthesis of EDM and visualization techniques such as brush-link visualization and visual summarization to interpret dynamic graphs representing ecosystem dynamics. We applied our proposed system to ecological simulation data and real data from a marine mesocosm study as two key use cases. Our case studies show that our visual analytics tools support the identification and interpretation of the system state by the user, and enable us to discover both confirmatory and new findings in ecosystem dynamics. Overall, we demonstrated that our system can facilitate an understanding of how systems function beyond the intuitive analysis of high-dimensional information based on specific domain knowledge.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028956","Keihanshin Consortium for Fostering the Next Generation of Global Leaders in Research (K-CONNEX); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:19K20278); JST CREST(grant numbers:JP-MJCR1511); Lenfest Ocean Program award(grant numbers:00028335); Department of Defense Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program(grant numbers:15 RC-2509); EPA-STAR Fellowship Program; National Science Foundation ABI-Innovation(grant numbers:DBI-1667584); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DEB-1020372); U.S. Department of the Interior(grant numbers:NPS-P20AC00527); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9216532","Visual analytics;empirical dynamic modeling;dynamic network;exploratory data analysis","Visual analytics;Time series analysis;Data visualization;Ecosystems;Task analysis;Time measurement;Ecology","biology computing;data analysis;data visualisation;ecology;graph theory;graphical user interfaces","GUI;time-varying system states;state-dependent manner;time series variables;mechanistic insights;observational time series data;empirical dynamic modeling;visual analytics approach;visual analytics tools;ecological simulation data;ecosystem dynamics;dynamic graphs;visual summarization;brush-link visualization;visualization techniques;EDM-constructed dynamic graph;visual analytics system;equation-free approach","","","","58","IEEE","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Manually generating a high-quality layout using this representation is labor-intensive. In this paper, we provide an automatic polygon layout generation algorithm for the visualization of N-ary relationships. At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data.

However, successfully reading and interpreting the data shown in an alluvial diagram is likely influenced by factors such as data volume, complexity, and chart layout. To understand how alluvial diagram consumption is impacted by its visual features, we conduct two crowdsourced user studies with a set of alluvial diagrams of varying complexity, and examine (i) participant performance on analysis tasks, and (ii) the perceived complexity of the charts. Using the study results, we employ Bayesian modelling to predict participant classification of diagram complexity. We find that, while multiple visual features are important in contributing to alluvial diagram complexity, interestingly the importance of features seems to depend on the type of complexity being modeled, i.e. task complexity vs. perceived complexity.","","978-1-6654-3335-8","10.1109/VIS49827.2021.9623282","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623282","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization techniques;Empirical studies in visualization","Visualization;Analytical models;Conferences;Computational modeling;Layout;Data visualization;Predictive models","Bayes methods;computational complexity;data visualisation;diagrams;flowcharting;relational databases","alluvial diagram complexity;task complexity;perceived complexity;Bayesian modelling;relational data;data volume;multiple visual features;chart layout","","","","34","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BSPI is an efficient 2D realization of a 3D BSP tree, which is commonly used in computer graphics for time-critical visibility sorting. Since the overall structure of a BSP tree is encoded in a BSPI, traversing a BSPI is comparable to traversing the corresponding BSP tree. BSPI performs visibility sorting efficiently and accurately in the 2D image space by warping the reference image triangle-by-triangle instead of pixel-by-pixel. Multiple BSPIs can be combined to solve ""disocclusion,"" when an occluded portion of the scene becomes visible at a novel viewpoint. Our method is highly automatic, including a tensor voting preprocessing step that generates candidate image partition lines for BSPIs, filters the noisy input data by rejecting outliers, and interpolates missing information.

However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time-varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long-time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in-depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time-varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi-dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real-world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114875","NSFC(grant numbers:62072400); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:LR18F020001); Collaborative Innovation Center of Artificial Intelligence by MOE and Zhejiang Provincial Government (ZJU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557222","Visual causal analysis;urban time series;causal graph analysis","Time series analysis;Visual analytics;Compass;Air pollution;Correlation;Urban planning;Indexes","air pollution;causality;data analysis;data visualisation;environmental science computing;graph theory;time series;traffic information systems","causal analyses;compass;real-world urban datasets;causal analysis;urban time series;spatial time series;urban phenomena;time series partitioning;long-time observations;dynamic urban causality;dynamic causality;interpreting dynamic causal relations;multiple causal graphs;causal detection framework;Granger causality test;dynamic causal graph visualization;time-varying causal relations;spurious causal relations;suspicious causal relations","","","","89","IEEE","1 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic discriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously considered “non-colorable” (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114780","Rob Nowak, Melissa Schoenlein, Kevin Lande, Tim Rogers, Chris Thorstenson, Anna Bartel, and Maureen Stone for helpful discussions(grant numbers:BCS-1945303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552216","Visual Reasoning;Information Visualization;Visual Communication;Visual Encoding;Color Cognition","Color;Semantics;Visualization;Image color analysis;Encoding;Plastics;Visual communication","data visualisation;feature extraction;graph theory;image colour analysis;statistical analysis;statistical testing;visual perception","perceptual encoding systems;specific associations;encoding system;perceptual features;semantic discriminability theory posits;feature-concept association distributions;semantically discriminable colors;color-concept association distributions;bar graphs;visual communication","","","","41","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main output of this work is a list of 32 representative features that can capture the underlying structures of bivariate data distributions. Through latent traversals, we seek for high-level semantics of the features and compare them to previous human-derived concepts such as scagnostics measures. Finally, using the 32 features as an input, we build a simple neural network to predict the perceptual distances between scatterplots that were previously scored by human annotators.

These clusters can result in ambiguous connections that do not exist in the data. Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the layout to be computed as part of the bundling process. We devise a new bundling method, Edge-Path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-Path bundling takes a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-Path bundling does not incur independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally emerges from the model.

Examples include control-flow graphs in programs and semantic scene graphs in images. Identifying subgraph patterns in graphs is an important approach to understand their structural properties. We propose a visual analytics system GraphQ to support human-in-the-loop, example-based, subgraph pattern search in a database containing many individual graphs. To support fast, interactive queries, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode a graph as fixed-length latent vector representation, and perform subgraph matching in the latent space. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is still difficult to obtain accurate one-to-one node correspondences in the matching results that are crucial for visualization and interpretation. We, therefore, propose a novel GNN for node-alignment called NeuroAlign, to facilitate easy validation and interpretation of the query results. GraphQ provides a visual query interface with a query editor and a multi-scale visualization of the results, as well as a user feedback mechanism for refining the results with additional constraints. We demonstrate GraphQ through two example usage scenarios: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows and semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that NeuroAlign achieves 19%-29% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to baseline GNN and provides up to 100× speedup compared to combinatorial algorithms. Our qualitative study with domain experts confirms the effectiveness for both usage scenarios.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552902","Graph;Graph Neural Network;Representation Learning;Visual Query Interface","Task analysis;Semantics;Visual analytics;Graph neural networks;Computational modeling;Visual databases;Pattern matching","data structures;data visualisation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;query processing;vectors","interactive visual pattern search;graph data;graph representation learning;ubiquitous data structure;control-flow graphs;semantic scene graphs;structural properties;visual analytics system GraphQ;subgraph pattern search;interactive queries;graph neural networks;fixed-length latent vector representation;subgraph matching;latent space;node correspondences;node-alignment;visual query interface;query editor;multiscale visualization;semantic scene graph search;NeuroAlign","","","","83","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, they visualize state changes as either slope or difference of bars, which has been proved less effective for quantitative comparison. Also, both visual designs suffer from visual clutter issues with an increasing number of data items. In this paper, we propose Intercept Graph, a novel visual design to facilitate effective interactive comparison of state changes. Specifically, a radial design is proposed to visualize the starting and ending states of each data item and the line segment length explicitly encodes the “state change By interactively adjusting the radius of the inner circular axis, Intercept Graph can smoothly filter the large state changes and magnify the difference between similar state changes, mitigating the visual clutter issues and enhancing the effective comparison of state changes.

Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews.

We present Neurocartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. Neurocartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting “dog faces” of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting “dog face” and “dog tail” are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs' relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. Neurocartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system's tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts. The Neurocartography visualization runs in modern browsers and is open-sourced.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114858","DARPA(grant numbers:HR00112030001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552879","Deep learning interpretability;visual analytics;scalable summarization;neuron clustering;neuron embedding","Neurons;Dogs;Feature extraction;Visualization;Faces;Deep learning;Semantics","data visualisation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;interactive systems;pattern clustering;public domain software","neuron-level interpretation;multiple neurons;higher-level concepts;dog face;dog tail;neuron pairs;concept associations;Neuron Projection View;human-meaningful concepts;concept cascades;scalable automatic visual summarization;deep neural networks;neurocartography visualization;neuron cluster summarization;interactive system;concept learning;concept semantic similarity;ImageNet dataset;graph view;neuron group discovery","Animals;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Dogs;Neural Networks, Computer;Neurons;Semantics","","","60","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, the memory footprint of these methods may exceed GPU memory limits. Interactive performance and high image quality are opposing goals. Our approach significantly lowers the burden to render unstructured datasets with high image fidelity while maintaining real-time and interactive performance even for large datasets. To this end, we leverage hardware-accelerated ray tracing to find entry and exit faces for a given ray into a volume and utilize a compact mesh representation to enable the efficient marching of arbitrary rays, thus allowing for advanced shading effects that ultimately yields more convincing and grounded images.

An existing ranking of these visual channels is based on how accurately participants could report the ratio between two depicted values. There is an assumption that this ranking should hold for different tasks and for different numbers of marks. However, there is surprisingly little existing work that tests this assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict more than two values. To simulate the information extracted from a glance at a visualization, we instead asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory after they were shown the visualization. These values could be shown in a bar graph (position (bar)), line graph (position (line)), heat map (luminance), bubble chart (area), misaligned bar graph (length), or ‘wind map’ (angle). With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we show how the rank positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or 8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new probabilistic ranking was highly inconsistent for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel choice had an order of magnitude more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the series (e.g., more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g., small values were systematically overestimated). Every visual channel was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with established limits on visual memory. These results point to the need for a body of empirical studies that move beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for reliably ranking the quality of a visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs), timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of values (from a handful, to thousands).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114684","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:BCS-1653457,IIS-1901485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9557878","DataType Agnostic;Human-Subjects Quantitative Studies;Perception & Cognition;Charts, Diagrams, and Plots","Task analysis;Visualization;Bars;Data visualization;Memory management;Measurement uncertainty;Correlation","Bayes methods;data visualisation;graph theory;probability;statistical analysis","real-world visualizations;rank positions;visual channels;visual memory;wind map;misaligned bar graph;channel choice;Bayesian multilevel modeling approach","","","","87","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the next step, the graph is transformed into a circular layout that maintains the semantics and yields simple Euler diagrams with smooth curves. When the data cannot be represented by simple diagrams, our algorithm always falls back to a solution that is not well-formed but still well-matched, whereas previous methods often fail to produce expected results.

To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes.

This motivates us to investigate the application of the 51 feature sets to phase-only images in addition to their use on the original data set.

Existing readability metrics fall short in three ways. The many count-based metrics such as edge-edge or node-edge crossings simply provide integer counts, missing the opportunity to quantify the amount of overlap between items, which may vary in size, at a more fine-grained level. Current metrics focus solely on single-level topological structure, ignoring the possibility of multi-level structure such as large and thus highly salient metanodes. Most current metrics focus on the measurement of clutter in the form of crossings and overlaps, and do not take into account the trade-off between the clutter and the information sparsity of the drawing, which we refer to as sprawl. We propose an area-aware approach to clutter metrics that tracks the extent of geometric overlaps between node-node, node-edge, and edge-edge pairs in detail. It handles variable-size nodes and explicitly treats metanodes and leaf nodes uniformly. We call the combination of a sprawl metric and an area-aware clutter metric a sprawlter metric. We present an instantiation of the sprawlter metrics featuring a formal and thorough discussion of the crucial component, the penalty mapping function.

In this article, we developed a novel shape correspondence learning network, called TC-NET, which further enhances performance by encouraging the topological consistency between the embedding feature space and the input shape space. Specifically, in this article, we first calculate the topology-associated edge weights to represent the topological structure of each point. Then, in order to preserve this topological structure in high-dimensional feature space, a structural regularization term is defined to minimize the topology-consistent feature reconstruction loss (Topo-Loss) during the correspondence learning process.

In addition, the proposed topology preservation concept can be easily generalized to other learning-based shape analysis tasks to regularize the topological structure of high-dimensional feature spaces.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.2994013","NYU Abu Dhabi Institute(grant numbers:AD131); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9091324","Topology preservation;shape correspondence;locally linear embedding;graph convolution","Shape;Topology;Heating systems;Manifolds;Image reconstruction;Kernel;Strain","feature extraction;graph theory;image matching;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;topology","topology constrained shape correspondence;deformation;structural variation;handcrafted point descriptors;data-driven manner;deep neural networks;robust point descriptor;local structural information;shape correspondence learning network;called TC-NET;topological consistency;embedding feature space;input shape space;topology-associated edge weights;topological structure;high-dimensional feature space;structural regularization term;topology-consistent feature reconstruction loss;correspondence learning process;shape correspondence benchmark datasets;topology preservation concept;learning-based shape analysis tasks","","","","53","IEEE","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, it is challenging to extract promising skeletons directly using existing approaches. This is because they either cannot fully preserve shape features, or require manual intervention, such as boundary smoothing and skeleton pruning, to justify the eye-level view assumption. We propose an approach here that generates backbone and dense skeletons by shape input, and then extends the backbone branches via skeleton grafting from the dense skeleton to ensure a well-integrated output. Based on our evaluation, the generated skeletons best depict the shapes at levels that are similar to human perception. To evaluate and fully express the properties of the extracted skeletons, we introduce two potential functions within the high-order matching protocol to improve the accuracy of skeleton-based matching. These two functions fuse the similarities between skeleton graphs and geometrical relations characterized by multiple skeleton endpoints. Experiments on three high-order matching protocols show that the proposed potential functions can effectively reduce the number of incorrect matches.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3003994","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:GRK 1564); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9122436","Skeleton extraction;skeleton matching;shape matching;skeleton grafting;high-order matching","Skeleton;Solid modeling;Bayes methods;Tuning;Feature extraction","feature extraction;graph theory;image matching","skeleton graphs;multiple skeleton endpoints;potential functions;skeleton grafting;visually promising skeletons;manual tuning;shape features;boundary smoothing;skeleton pruning;eye-level view assumption;dense skeleton;generated skeletons;extracted skeletons;automatic skeleton extraction;high-order matching protocol","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Humans;Skeleton","","","71","IEEE","22 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hypergraph models can provide a more accurate representation of the underlying processes while reducing the overall number of links compared to regular representations. However, interactive visualization methods for hypergraphs and hypergraph-based models have rarely been explored or systematically analyzed. This paper reviews the existing research landscape for hypergraph and hypergraph model visualizations and assesses the currently employed techniques. We provide an overview and a categorization of proposed approaches, focusing on performance, scalability, interaction support, successful evaluation, and the ability to represent different underlying data structures, including a recent demand for a temporal representation of interaction networks and their improvements beyond graph-based methods. Lastly, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and give an insight into the future challenges arising in this emerging research field.","","978-1-6654-3335-8","10.1109/VIS49827.2021.9623305","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623305","Hypergraphs;hypergraph model;temporal;visualization;visual analytics;survey","Proteins;Analytical models;Visualization;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Scalability;Image retrieval","data mining;data structures;data visualisation;graph theory;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);network theory (graphs);proteins","static hypergraph visualizations;dynamic hypergraph visualizations;leveraging hypergraph structures;advanced processes;protein-interaction;computational biology;image retrieval;machine learning;hypergraph models;regular representations;interactive visualization methods;hypergraphs;hypergraph-based models;existing research landscape;hypergraph model visualizations;interaction support;different underlying data structures;temporal representation;interaction networks;graph-based methods","","","","45","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This topological segmentation is closely related to the theory of Lagrangian coherent structures and is based on a recently introduced quantity, the diffusion barrier strength (DBS). The DBS is defined similar to the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE), but incorporates diffusion during flow integration. Height ridges of the DBS indicate stochastic transport barriers and enhancers, i.e. material surfaces that are minimally or maximally diffusive. To apply these concepts to real-world data, we represent uncertainty in a flow by a stochastic differential equation that consists of a deterministic and a stochastic component modeled by a Gaussian. With this formulation we identify barriers and enhancers to stochastic transport, without performing expensive Monte Carlo simulation and with a computational complexity comparable to FTLE. In addition, we propose a complementary visualization to convey the absolute scale of uncertainties in the Lagrangian frame of reference. This enables us to study uncertainty in real-world datasets, for example due to small deviations, data reduction, or estimated from multiple ensemble runs.","","978-1-7281-8014-4","10.1109/VIS47514.2020.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331300","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Scientific visualization","Uncertainty;Monte Carlo methods;Satellite broadcasting;Measurement uncertainty;Stochastic processes;Data visualization;Probabilistic logic","computational complexity;computational fluid dynamics;data visualisation;differential equations;flow;Gaussian processes;Lyapunov methods;stochastic processes;topology","DBS;stochastic transport barriers;material surfaces;stochastic differential equation;stochastic component;FTLE;uncertain transport;unsteady flows;time-dependent flow dynamics;topological segmentation;Lagrangian coherent structures;diffusion barrier strength;finite-time Lyapunov exponent;flow integration;complementary visualization","","","","24","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we address the challenge of uncertainty visualization of the topology cases of the MS and MC algorithms for uncertain scalar field data sampled on a uniform grid. The visualization of the MS and MC topology cases for uncertain data is challenging due to their exponential nature and the possibility of multiple topology cases per cell of a grid. We propose the topology case count and entropy-based techniques for quantifying uncertainty in the topology cases of the MS and MC algorithms when noise in data is modeled with probability distributions. We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques for independent and correlated uncertainty assumptions. We visualize the quantified topological uncertainty via color mapping proportional to uncertainty, as well as with interactive probability queries in the MS case and entropy isosurfaces in the MC case. We demonstrate the utility of our uncertainty quantification framework in identifying the isovalues exhibiting relatively high topological uncertainty. We illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques via results on synthetic, simulation, and hixel datasets.","","978-1-6654-3335-8","10.1109/VIS49827.2021.9623267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623267","Human-centered computing;Visualization;Visualization application domains;Scientific visualization","Uncertainty;Image color analysis;Conferences;Computational modeling;Probability distribution;Entropy;Data models","computational geometry;data visualisation;entropy;probability;topology","uncertainty visualization;marching squares;marching cubes topology cases;level-set visualization;scientific data;uncertain scalar field data;uniform grid;uncertain data;multiple topology cases;topology case count;entropy-based techniques;independent uncertainty assumptions;correlated uncertainty assumptions;quantified topological uncertainty;MS case;MC case;uncertainty quantification framework;relatively high topological uncertainty","","","","27","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While several techniques exist in the literature, they can only be applied to classical fluids. As quantum fluids with turbulence are gaining attention in physics, extracting and visualizing vortex-core lines for quantum fluids is increasingly desirable. In this article, we develop an efficient vortex-core line vectorization method for quantum fluids enabling real-time visualization of high-resolution quantum turbulence structure. From a dataset obtained through simulation, our technique first identifies vortex nodes based on the circulation field. To vectorize the vortex-core lines interpolating these vortex nodes, we propose a novel graph-based data structure, with iterative graph reduction and density-guided local optimization, to locate sub-grid-scale vortex-core line samples more precisely, which are then vectorized by continuous curves. This vortex-core representation naturally captures complex topology, such as branching during reconnection. Our vectorization approach reduces memory consumption by orders of magnitude, enabling real-time visualization performance. Different types of interactive visualizations are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of our technique, which could help further research on quantum turbulence.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.2981460","ShanghaiTech University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9039696","Quantum turbulence;vortex-core line vectorization;real-time visualization;graph representation","Mathematical model;Visualization;Real-time systems;Data visualization;Quantum mechanics;Quantum computing","data structures;data visualisation;flow visualisation;graph theory;interpolation;turbulence;vectors;vortices","interactive visualizations;quantum turbulence vortex-core lines;vectorizing vortex-core lines;high-quality visualization;classical fluids;quantum fluids;vortex-core line vectorization method;high-resolution quantum turbulence structure;vortex nodes;novel graph-based data structure;iterative graph reduction;density-guided local optimization;sub-grid-scale vortex-core line samples;vortex-core representation;vectorization approach;real-time visualization performance","","","","62","IEEE","17 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Encoding edge probability using visual variables like width or fuzziness makes it difficult for users of static network visualizations to estimate network statistics like densities, isolates, path lengths, or clustering under uncertainty. We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network realizations sampled from a network distribution defined by probabilistic edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability for uncertainty estimation. We present a community matching algorithm to enable visualizing the uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants' estimates fell, on average, within 11% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared to articulate the distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed. Based on these findings, we synthesize design recommendations for developing and using animated visualizations for probabilistic networks.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114679","NSF(grant numbers:IIS-1907941,IIS-1815760); Microsoft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552465","Network;Uncertainty;Application","Probabilistic logic;Visualization;Uncertainty;Layout;Task analysis;Stability analysis;Encoding","computer animation;data visualisation;graph theory;image representation;probability","probabilistic graphs;Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots;NetHOPs;traditional node-link diagram;encoding edge probability;visual variables;static network visualizations;network statistics;visualization technique;network realizations;network distribution;probabilistic edges;aggregation;anchoring algorithm;dynamic graph;longitudinal graph;uncertainty estimation;51 network experts;common visual analysis tasks;network structures;network analysts;animated visualizations;probabilistic networks","","","","93","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
