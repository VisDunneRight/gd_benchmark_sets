From the abstract of the connected paper:

> Computational evaluations are crucial for standardized and objective evaluation of graph layout algorithms. Standard benchmark datasets facilitate comparison with prior work, and reliable access to datasets is fundamental for replicability. However, there is no comprehensive repository of benchmark datasets for Graph Drawing, and many datasets have been lost.

> We collected 196 papers from Graph Drawing, IEEE venues, and Eurographics venues that include computational evaluations of graph layout algorithms. We searched for the datasets used.

> We provide a [Graph Benchmark Datasets](https://visdunneright.github.io/gd_benchmark_sets/) website; a [repository](https://github.com/visdunneright/gd_benchmark_sets/) with code for the website and metadata on the benchmark datasets; a [long-term archive](https://osf.io/j7ucv/) of this repository and the benchmark datasets.
